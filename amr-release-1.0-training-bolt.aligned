Then, three people ran up to him, kicking and beaing him (according to the police, they had drunk four cases of beer at the time). As a result, my father's skull suffered serious injury. He bled profusely and lost consciousness. By the time he was taken to the hospital, his pupils were already dilated. However, with prompt rescue given by a doctor, he survived.
