<h1>Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) Annotation Release 1.0</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">LDC2014T12</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) Annotation Release 1.0, Linguistic Data 
  Consortium (LDC) Catalog Number LDC2014T12 and ISBN 1-58563-677-0, was developed 
  by LDC, <a href="http://www.sdl.com/products/automated-translation/">SDL/Language 
  Weaver, Inc.</a>, the University of Colorado's <a href="http://clear.colorado.edu/start/index.html">Computational 
  Language and Educational Research</a> group and the <a href="http://www.isi.edu/home">Information 
  Sciences Institute</a> at the University of Southern California. It contains 
  a sembank (semantic treebank) of over 13,000 English natural language sentences 
  from newswire, weblogs and web discussion forums. </p>
<p>AMR captures “who is doing what to whom” in a sentence. Each sentence is paired 
  with a graph that represents its whole-sentence meaning in a tree-structure.   
  AMR utilizes PropBank frames, non-core semantic roles, within-sentence coreference, 
  named entity annotation, modality, negation, questions, quantities, and so on 
  to represent the semantic structure of a sentence largely independent of its 
  syntax.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The source data includes discussion forums collected for the DARPA BOLT program, 
  Wall Street Journal and translated Xinhua news texts, various newswire data 
  from NIST OpenMT evaluations and weblog data used in the DARPA GALE program. 
  The following table summarizes the number of training, dev, and test AMRs for 
  each dataset in the release. Totals are also provided by partition and dataset: </p>

<table border ="1" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<td>Dataset</td><td>Training</td><td>Dev</td><td>Test</td><td>Totals</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>BOLT DF MT</td><td>1061</td><td>133</td><td>133</td><td>1327</td>
</tr>  
<tr><td>Weblog and WSJ</td><td>0</td><td>100</td><td>100</td><td>200</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>BOLT DF English</td><td>1703</td><td>210</td><td>229</td><td>2142</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>2009 Open MT</td><td>204</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>204</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Proxy reports</td><td>6603</td><td>826</td><td>823</td><td>8252</td>
</tr>  
<tr><td>Xinhua MT</td><td>741</td><td>99</td><td>86</td><td>926</td>
</tr>  
<tr><td>Totals</td><td>10312</td><td>1368</td><td>1371</td><td>13051</td>
</tr></table>

<p>For those interested in a utilizing a standard/community partition for AMR 
  research (for instance in development of semantic parsers), data in the "split" 
  directory contains 13,051 AMRs divided roughly 80/10/10 into training/dev/test 
  partitions, with most smaller datasets assigned to one of the splits as a whole. 
  Note that splits observe document boundaries. The "unsplit" directory contains 
  the same 13,051 AMRs with no train/dev/test partition.</p>

<h3>Directory Structure</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="data/">data/</a> - Contains AMR data divided in a standard partition 
    for AMR research and as one set.</li>
<li><a href="docs/">docs/</a> - Contains additional documentation, guidelines and a file table.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Updates</h3>
