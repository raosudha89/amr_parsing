# ::snt Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to uni- you're definitely not alone there. But I would really recommend that you get an appointment with your uni counselling services. It doesn't really matter whether anyone has told you that you are depressed or not, you are obviously having some problems at the minute and could use some support- labels aren't as important as your experiences. Meditation and exercise are really helpful, so definitely try to do those. But yeah, you will have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere- but don't beat yourself up about feeling unmotivated to do anything at the minute, lots of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better. Being unkind to yourself will only make you feel worse- be kind to yourself and get some help.
