Establishing Models in Industrial Innovation
After its competitor invented the front loading washing machine , the CEO of the American IM company believed that each of its employees had the ability for innovation , and formulated strategic countermeasures for innovation in the industry .
1. Establish an innovation fund with a maximum amount of 1,000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollars .
2. Choose 100 innovative concepts to encourage employees to conduct research and development during their work time or spare time .
3. From among them , pick out 50 for submission to an assessment committee to assess .
Since the <LOCATION>Tangshan Earthquake</LOCATION> , the starting point for construction standards in the mainland is that under an earthquake of the same magnitude , buildings should preserve their basic frame without collapsing .
However , most of the buildings in this hard - hit area did not meet these requirements , with the widespread collapse of school buildings in particular arousing intense public disgust .
Raising standards to in excess of <LOCATION>Tangshan</LOCATION> 's 8.0 magnitude could leave authorities with some breathing space for explanation , and alleviate public anger .
According to information leaked from numerous channels , we can say for certain that before the earthquake struck , the serious earthquake risk in the <LOCATION>Ngawa</LOCATION> region was already well known to the <ORGANIZATION>CCP</ORGANIZATION> .
Although current forecasting standards cannot give us an accurate prediction of the exact time , place , and strength of an earthquake , there is considerable experience accumulated both in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and overseas in predicting to within the timeframe of a month , and the area of a province .
In regions where the earthquake risk is high , warning the public and spreading disaster prevention awareness could greatly reduce casualties during earthquakes ; this is the very minimum duty that any responsible government should undertake .
In the past the <ORGANIZATION>CCP</ORGANIZATION> has done a lot of these sorts of things , but on this occasion not only did nothing , but in response to queries from the public pulled out some whopping lies , playing syntax games with words like " geological disaster " and " earthquake disaster " .
I think that if our <ORGANIZATION>Earthquake Administration</ORGANIZATION> had been able beforehand to do a simulation of big earthquakes on this <LOCATION>Longmenshan</LOCATION> mountain earthquake belt , then on that day of <DATE>May 12</DATE> , once the <ORGANIZATION>Earthquake Administration</ORGANIZATION> had measured the quake at a magnitude of 7.8 , we would have been able to broadly judge the extent of damage and destruction in the earthquake disaster zone .
If the simulation program was well designed , circumstances like debris blocking roads , heavy rainfall obstructing parachute drops , power and communication outages should all have been within expectations .
Instead in this instance the <ORGANIZATION>Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> headquarters emergency contingency plan obviously was not a contingency plan designed with earthquakes as the assumed condition , as the soldiers all rushed straight to <LOCATION>Wenchuan</LOCATION> , without immediately sending out troops in the direction of badly - hit areas <LOCATION>Beichuan</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Qingchuan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Gansu</LOCATION> 's <LOCATION>Longnan</LOCATION> ; only 24 hours later was the full extent of the disaster area taken into consideration .
In addition , the breakdown in communication also brought a serious problem to the surface . In the past , <ORGANIZATION>Red Army</ORGANIZATION> regiments were able to maintain contact with central headquarters by relying on just one battered radio . On this occasion though , people had no way to deal with the communication failure .
It is clear that preparations prior to the event were not constructed on the basis of an earthquake disaster simulation .
While it should have been a disaster relief command that takes overall leadership , it has suddenly come face - to - face with the broad base of disaster victims , directly dealing with them .
The lack or serious shortage of intermediate layers of Party organizations and units between the two has resulted in its inability to consider major issues with endless minor issues on hand , such that even if it is highly capable , it wo n't last long , as it will be dragged down by numerous petty things .
This would have been unimaginable during the <ORGANIZATION>Great Tangshan Earthquake</ORGANIZATION> . A time without volunteers or mental workers , such petty things as directly dealing with average people were performed by the most primary Party branches , as well as enterprises and public institutions .
As soon as the earthquake occurred , grass - root organizations contacted their own people and average people also contacted their own systems or departments , in an interdependent manner .
Under the centralized leadership of higher - level organizations , everyone acted to make the rescue efforts very outstanding and successful , such that the <ORGANIZATION>Great Tangshan Earthquake</ORGANIZATION> , which happened just a few years ago , was forgotten all together in the subsequent reform and opening - up .
It is obvious that no social or political problems were left then , nor were sequelae that cause headaches to later generations .
During a time of prosperity and happiness , such a big earthquake suddenly struck .
Many people died , much property was destroyed , it was quite clearly a great disaster .
But it was not totally without benefits , and I believe that its greatest benefit was that it served to strip off the false benevolence that composed the outer skin of the elitists , the politicians , the capitalists , and exposed once and for all the rotten cannibalistic core within .
And an additional benefit was that many people who had been deluded came to their senses .
Temporarily laid aside these abstract things and avoided speaking at length , saying only a few details that left the elitists , the politicians and capitalists highly embarrassed .
The experts had just finished saying " Sacrificing yourself to help others is a foolish idea " , when the leaders had no choice but to call once again for selfless devotion .
This was mere chicanery , to the point where before engaging in life - saving , donation to charity , these sorts of behaviors , an idea had to be flashing through people 's minds :
Am I being foolish in doing this ?
And when people saw on <ORGANIZATION>CCTV</ORGANIZATION> those private firms manufacturing tents in <LOCATION>Jiangsu</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zhejiang</LOCATION> working overtime to produce more tents , the first idea that popped to mind I 'm afraid was probably " This time these capitalists have struck it big ! "
" Why is it that these capitalists instead of those capitalists get the big order forms , surely there could n't be anything fishy involved ?
During this process , there were again talks about filing a complaint against the <ORGANIZATION>Xinghui Travel Agency</ORGANIZATION> .
The reason for filing the complaint is that even if we owed their hourly fees , they still should fulfill their obligation on the contract they signed : driving people from <LOCATION>Canberra</LOCATION> back to <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> .
As long as we stick to this issue , Xinghui surely has no way of winning the lawsuit if it goes to court .
However , what greatly surprised me was the attitude of the student union in this appeal . They seemed very reluctant to make the contract public .
They even lied , saying that they and Xinghui initially felt that signing a contract would rather make each other feel like strangers since they were both doing it for the sake of the motherland .
As you know , this type of logic absolutely wo n't work in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> .
Xinghui accepted this order of ours and deployed all the buses of other travel agencies in <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> .
Without the guarantee from the contract signed with us , they would surely have been unable to deploy them !
In addition , there was something else that was very suspicious .
I heard from a friend at the consulate that the government took this matter very seriously and had promptly agreed to allocate funds to compensate the students who had used their own money instead that night .
Yesterday afternoon I went back to check out the torch relay , but even the flame was practically impossible to see , let alone the guys carrying the torch .
There were so many people there it was frightening . Some had even climbed onto the roofs of buses !
I headed straight for the center of activities , but in actual fact traffic was being controlled as early as 4 o'clock , and they had already started limiting the crowds entering the sports center .
Some guys were really insane , banding together in groups and yelling out " Go <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> ! "
I actually had some other classmates there , and was going to call them .
I guessed the carrying capacity of the base station towers was totally overloaded , and I could n't get through at all . I was only able to find a signal , not a chance of connecting to the Internet .
Only one phone call I made there got through - that was calling home .
I had a look at my call register , and out of dozens of calls dialed only one was properly connected !
Sometime after 6 I went straight back home to watch it on TV . The spectacle was just as astonishing on TV , except that it was just one angle of the whole thing .
Next time I wo n't be partaking in this kind of activity !!
<PERSON>Wang Shi</PERSON> 's experience of being under public condemnation underscored to a certain extent the tense relationship between the rich and poor classes in Chinese society ;
because as <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> grows prosperous day by day , the gap of wealth between the successful elite and the remaining 1.3 billion people is widening .
Thirty years ago , people had basically the same incomes , which were all deplorably meager .
However , Hurun Report ( Hurun Report ) shows that by <DATE>2007</DATE> , there were a total of 106 billionaires ( in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollars ) in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , with the number of people only next to that of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .
Now , <PERSON>Wang Shi</PERSON> said , these responses have had effects on me .
He admitted that he was not sensitive enough to the current situation when he wrote his blog .
Wang Shi noted additionally that since <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> currently has not yet established a sound system of social security insurance , the growing hatred of the rich is unavoidable .
On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , <PERSON>Wanke</PERSON> announced that it would make an additional donation of RMB 100 million yuan for the temporary resettlement and post - disaster reconstruction in the next three to five years .
Yao Ming , the basketball player who was hailed as a national hero thanks to his success in establishing himself in <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> , was also blamed after he announced his donation of RMB two million yuan because a rumor on the Internet alleged he had donated <MONEY>one million U.S. dollars</MONEY> for disaster relief of Hurricane Katrina ( Hurricane ) in <DATE>2005</DATE> .
Even so , donation behavior and the treatment of donation behavior should not deviate from two principles , namely that it is voluntary and does not seek return . Otherwise , the donation loses its original meaning .
In actual fact , whether it is <ORGANIZATION>McDonalds</ORGANIZATION> or any other foreign owned enterprises in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> on the so - called " international iron rooster " blacklist , they all gave generously to the cause of helping the disaster victims , exhibiting their social responsibility .
Even if by comparison some companies really did n't donate a huge amount , they should not be besieged or subjected to verbal violence in the arena of public opinion .
Donating , after all , is not a legal obligation that companies must carry out . Urging businesses to donate apart from the force of moral considerations should not take the form of any other coercive means .
As long as a company 's source of income is legal , any compulsory payment outside of legal obligations is a kind of theft .
Even in an abnormal circumstance such as disaster relief , legal order and the rights bestowed upon by law should be respected .
If we are unfortunate enough to be unable to avoid becoming a disaster victim , we can at least preserve the nobility and dignity of humanity and not turn into rabble .
The lawsuit proposed by <PERSON>Hai Ming</PERSON> did not have a clear subject of the right of action ; moreover it did not satisfy the legal requirement for libel .
For example , he failed to clarify whether <PERSON>Cafferty</PERSON> 's comment was an argument over opinions or an act of spreading an untruthful statement .
The malicious intent of <PERSON>Cafferty</PERSON> has not been established , either . More importantly , he has been unable to offer anything as to how to establish the damage to the 1.3 billion Chinese people .
In addition , in his complaint , it is said that Chinese people have already expressed their displeasure through demonstrations .
Here it is a country with the freedom of speech .
On the issue of libel , courts only support those who have actually suffered damages and have no other way to seek justice .
Therefore , it is very hard for the government , politicians , and public figures to get legal protection on the issue of libel ,
because they have the capability to clear themselves of " smears . "
If you have already cleared your own reputation through legal protests , for example , Chinese people are not goons and thugs , then a lawsuit is meaningless .
Remember , a lawsuit for libel is only to clear your name and get compensation .
After <PERSON>Lee Teng</PERSON> - hui put forth the " two states theory " , due to mainland countrymen being deceived by the <ORGANIZATION>CCP</ORGANIZATION> 's propaganda machine , many people advocated using force to unite <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> .
Because they have no understanding whatsoever of the situation in <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and the will of the <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> people ,
hey universally exhibited extreme nationalistic sentiment .
Just like the love - hate fusion of nationalistic war sentiment that erupted after the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> mistakenly bombed the Chinese embassy .
They similarly did not understand the real story in <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> .
But <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> people realize that first there was the Republic of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , only after that came " <LOCATION>New China</LOCATION> " ;
While this " Two States Separatist Theory " has purely and simply been dreamed up by the <ORGANIZATION>CCP</ORGANIZATION> .
Lee Teng - hui was doing nothing but bringing an already existing phenomenon to light .
Moreover , the grand old men of the <ORGANIZATION>CCP</ORGANIZATION> who handed over on a silver platter a huge chunk of land in <LOCATION>Manchuria</LOCATION> north of the <LOCATION>Amur River</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Soviet Russia</LOCATION> , who gave away land equivalent to <PERCENT>ten percent</PERCENT> of national territory in northern <LOCATION>Mongolia</LOCATION> ; why not take this back , instead of insisting on trying to grab back a <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> that remains in the hands of Chinese people ?
However , even though <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> people have their grumbles , the " two states theory " has in no way triggered a sentimental attachment in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> people for " Old <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> " .
I believe that our building industry here has not yet reached this level .
Not only has the law not yet reached this level , but the average person 's understanding has generally not reached this level .
Some officials , out of local economic considerations , by accident or design are frequently too lenient in dealing with property agents .
We all saw the damage wreaked by the <ORGANIZATION>Wenchuan Earthquake</ORGANIZATION> .
As to how much of this was a result of natural disaster , and how much was man - made calamity , a verdict will be drawn in the end .
Apparently , quality checks in the space industry are extremely rigorous , each part undergoes several inspection processes , every effort is made to ensure absolute safety .
But space ship accidents still happen from time to time .
Even such technologically advanced nations as the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> have experienced several instances of space flight launch or return failures .
Since things can still go wrong even when they are subjected to incredibly rigorous inspections as in the space industry , then , with our current " dark " and corrupt property industry the way it is , people 's lives are even harder to place guarantees on .
Once a powerful earthquake strikes , the people 's lives really do become as tiny as those of ants .
It makes one tremble even without fear .
Following the <LOCATION>Great Wenchuan Earthquake</LOCATION> this time , there were compatriots who struggled out of the debris , wiped their tears and buried the bodies of their families , but they braced up again and declared to the world , " we are not beaten down ; we are on our feet again ; the earthquake cannot shake the staunch will of the Chinese people ; trials and tribulations serve only to revitalize a nation ! "
This enables us to see the fighting spirits of the dauntless Chinese nation give off a dazzling radiance among people in disaster - hit areas .
The fact that these words are spoken by compatriots who have been through the disaster has given us , who could n't help our tears at the sight of their mishaps , so much comfort and encouragement . It gives us a hint that no force can beat down the Chinese people .
However , the words later reappeared somewhere else and from someone unusual , which I thought about for a few days . I feel , for some unknown reason , it is somewhat scary !
I just want to say , let there be no more disasters , so that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is safe and sound from now on and disasters are far away from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
I pray to the God to open his eyes and do n't let disasters visit the Chinese land again !
We do n't want to revitalize the nation through trials and tribulations ,
but rather we want to revitalize the nation by passing our days safe and sound !
One important reason that a great number of people buried or trapped in debris in the <LOCATION>Wenchuan</LOCATION> earthquake - hit area were saved is that they were full of hopes and firmly believed the <ORGANIZATION>PLA</ORGANIZATION> would come to their rescue !
To settle victims , thousands of tents that stretched miles were soon set up , which contained public toilets , shops , and primary schools and middle schools .
Tens of thousands or even millions of those displaced by the disaster have gradually had a home to shelter from the wind and rain !
If everything were put in the market , such that all the land was sold to syndicates or farm owners , then where should the government set up tents ?
Do they expropriate the land on the spot ?
Even the government cannot override the market !
Supporting the disaster - hit areas has tested our competence , while the government 's ability to rule also stood the trial !
At critical moments , the ruling foundation --- workers and farmers , showed staunch support to the government !
If everything were put in the market , such that workers and farmers would have their fates controlled by the market and no longer count on or rely on the government by walking onto a path of the so - called " finding the market rather than the mayor ( government ) , " then what power would the government have ?
The post - catastrophe hyperinflation as expected by foreigners has not come either !
The government has human and financial capital under control , as well as energy and resources !
For example , the value of " seizing the pleasure of the moment " also has a long history .
" Sing a song when thou have wine , seize the day since life is short . " Some people in contemporary times think we should " satisfy and die . "
Some people have gone so far on the road that they " do n't know how to eat or play , "
and other take nude pictures and flaunt them online .
For another example , the pursuit of office titles and levels can also be traced back to the old days .
In ancient times there was <PERSON>Zhou Li</PERSON> to distinguish the order of hierarchy and nobility , constructing a pyramid - like social organizational structure .
The son of the <ORGANIZATION>Heaven</ORGANIZATION> wore different clothes than others . The color of a door and the number of caldrons used for meals were all symbols to distinguish the hierarchy and nobility of people .
The aim was to settle disputes , stop fights and stabilize the society .
However , simultaneously it has also established a system that values life according to office levels , which to the contrary triggered contentions and destabilized the society .
Yet no matter how many changes of dynasties there are , the value system has always been carried on .
Higher or lower ranks in Qing Dynasty were distinguished by bird and animal patterns on clothes , <ORGANIZATION>Taiping Heavenly Kingdom</ORGANIZATION> used the size and color of a sedan chair as the symbol to distinguish between different ranks , and modern people use the motor vehicle displacement as a symbol to distinguish between different positions , all of which can be traced to the same origin .
I do n't care how much Wang Shi wastes every time he climbs a mountain , but I do strongly despise how he talks and the way he acts during this whole thing .
After donating , he suggested that charity should not be the burden of businesses , and therefore stipulated that his company 's employee donations should not exceed 10 yuan .
Totally absurd logic . <PERSON>Wang Shi</PERSON> 's reasoning is that making donations to charities then the burden of businesses could cause companies to fail in market competition ;
But we can see such philanthropists as <PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON> , <PERSON>Li Ka</PERSON> - shing , <PERSON>Jackie Chan</PERSON> have not affected the growth of their enterprises in any way . Instead , they have actually increased the competitiveness of their companies .
And there were some netizens who hit back in the Wang Shi donations issue by admonishing us for forcing donations on moral grounds .
Exactly ! An excellent justification !
If you say that netizens rebuking <PERSON>Wang Shi</PERSON> is forcing donations , then what kind of behavior is <PERSON>Wang Shi</PERSON> preventing employees from donating more than 10 yuan ?
<PERSON>Wang Shi</PERSON> is the economic version of a cold - blooded animal , and we do n't care ,
but how come <PERSON>Wang Shi</PERSON> , how come he wants to restrict what employees do or do n't do on moral grounds ?
This really is a case of one rule for some , another rule for everyone else !!!
We see , as at <DATE>May 17</DATE> , the Chinese government has accepted up to <MONEY>6 billion</MONEY> in disaster - relief donations domestically and internationally , of which 4.8 billion is from domestic donors .
What we can see now are merely the name and figure of each donor constantly listed in what is like an honor roll .
Yet unfortunately , we do n't have more detailed information of the whereabouts and specific uses of the donated funds .
As corruption has long been prevalent among local governments and economic auditing is not transparent enough , disaster - relief funds are often appropriated , exhausted , expropriated and embezzled .
Therefore , once such a huge amount of disaster - relief funds from people the world and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> are embezzled or otherwise partially transferred by local officials , the resulting political damage and lowering of the government 's image domestically and internationally will completely negate the positive image brought by the government 's disaster - relief efforts .
If the donations are directly put in the hands of disaster - hit people , it would push local prices higher , driving the already high inflation to a direction that is even harder to regulate .
It is said that our country 's earthquake forecasting is at an advanced level in the world .
But the glory of the earthquake workers did not produce good luck for the departed spirits of Wenchuan .
So , we again hear expert figures emphasizing once again , " Earthquake forecasts are a global challenge that so far no one has been able to solve . "
Consequently , we come to realize that the academic laurels for " the success rates of predictions of impending earthquakes that have already reached almost <PERCENT>40 %</PERCENT> " are just conditions and capital used to apply for funding , evaluate professional titles and seek remuneration , rather than a hard rationale used to reduce bloodshed and deaths .
We should offer earthquake workers our full understanding .
Facing the caprice of nature , humankind is really insignificant .
Furthermore , although our sense of security increases with each passing day in line with " significant advances achieved " in seismology , we cannot look to anyone to give us any promises .
Because , once someone has made a promise , he would be doomed thereafter to bear this bloody weight of " being unable to effectively avoid earthquake disasters . "
And by not issuing any promises , he could actually avoid being censured .
Because " there is no way to make predictions " !
Humans can manufacture tanks that are much more powerful than ants , but humans cannot manufacture a living ant ...
However advanced instruments manufactured by humans are , their level of complexity cannot compare with a section of a toad 's nerve .
Do not regard earthquake prediction as a " practical skill " ; rather regard it as academic work in a study .
Take no notice of the real results in terms of preventing earthquakes or minimizing disasters ; rather singlemindedly pursue the scientific research level embodied in " prediction success rates . "
In the course of major disaster warnings , too many disputes relating to powers and interests are entangled .
The directions of research into earthquake prevention and disaster minimization are just confined to research into the phenomenon of earthquakes , but efforts to intervene in urban construction , to formulate and supervise building standards , and perfect and improve disaster rescue mechanisms and other aspects have been neglected .... .
We have also become blindly abreast of foreign countries even in earthquake research : we do n't believe in living beings raised as part of nature ; we just believe in the instruments we ourselves manufacture .
We do n't believe the warnings sent out by nature ; we just believe the warnings emitted by instruments in laboratories .
We do n't believe in what is seen and heard with their own eyes by millions of ordinary people ; we just believe in the authoritative conclusions of experts and scholars .
Chinese seismology is galloping down the wrong road .
Real estate is only one part of the national economy but the real estate phenomenon exists in every sector of the national economy .
The swift large - scale failure and bankruptcy of collective enterprises and state - owned enterprises is proof of this .
Things have reached the step where the national television station has to set up a stage with the country 's military singers , high - class singers , as well as top - of - the - line celebrities from all walks of life singing to folks like <PERSON>Wang Shi</PERSON> for donations .
We should n't be too bothered if folks like <PERSON>Wang Shi</PERSON> say something unpleasant .
A defeated general ca n't claim to be brave .
In front of folks like <PERSON>Wang Shi</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>State Council</ORGANIZATION> are all defeated generals .
Because the missing - in - action army who built <LOCATION>New China</LOCATION> have been beaten to a pulp by folks like <PERSON>Wang Shi</PERSON> ; even if <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has no earthquakes , there will be floods , as well as SARS , snowstorms , big freezes etc.
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is a land of many catastrophes - this has always been true and always will be .
Relying on singing for donations , entertaining for one 's supper , will not solve the problem .
And time and time again asking the national television station to get out there and carry the national flag , carrying on like this in the name of the country is outrageous , it 's the <ORGANIZATION>State Council</ORGANIZATION> 's problem .
All the people with one mind " as the national anthem is inspired by the foresight of " always being prepared " , designed for " advance , advance , advance , enter ! " instead of being designed for repeated begging , pleading for donations , and fund - raising .
From leaders to the common people , everyone needs to keep that in mind .
When we go back to the 10th Century AD , we find that the 10th Century AD gave birth to the first entrepreneurs .
Because the 10th Century AD was the very time when limited liability companies were established ; the Catholic Pope of the time had such a conviction during the <ORGANIZATION>9th Century</ORGANIZATION> .
Are you afraid of going to Hell when you die ?
Yes , you are afraid - how could you not go just because you are afraid ?
Donate your property to the Church , show your loyalty to God and you wo n't go to Hell ,
so a lot of rich people donated their money to the <ORGANIZATION>Church</ORGANIZATION> before they died .
By the <ORGANIZATION>10th Century AD</ORGANIZATION> , <PERCENT>60 %</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 's territory belonged to the Church ,
but their clergymen could n't manage it , and were unable to pass it on to the next generation . What could they do ?
So they set up the modern limited liability company .
How did they set it up ?
They hired professional managers to run these Church enterprises ,
hese professional managers were the administrators ,
And who were the proprietors of these companies ?
The Church .
So what did this confirm ?
The first step in separating the administration rights from ownership ,
in no way because this was a great system , but rather that this was inevitable within the Church enterprises .
When forecasting earthquakes , why did it happen that only a few cases were successful while most cases were failures ?
According to this writer 's many years of research on precursory signs , the existence of precursory signs and earthquake predictions are two issues that are both connected and mutual differentiated .
The appearance of a precursory sign does n't mean it can accurately forecast the three elements of an earthquake , because precursory signs are extremely complicated .
There are certain differences in the categories , breadths , distribution ranges , and duration of precursory signs of different types of earthquakes in different places .
In " Regional Nature of Precursory Signs of Earthquakes , " this writer divides earthquakes into two major types according to the overall characteristics of pre - earthquake signs : strike - type and slip - type earthquakes .
The former occurs in areas where internal fault blocks or fault lines converge but not intersect , while the latter occurs in active fault lines .
Strike - type earthquakes have various types of precursory signs , which are widespread , long - lasting , and quite variable .
Slip - type earthquakes have fewer types of precursory signs , which have a smaller distribution range , shorter duration period , and smaller range of change .
In <LOCATION>Chengdu</LOCATION> , which is over 100 kms away from the epicenter , the earthquake should not have an intensity of over 7 , or 8 at the most .
There should not be any safety problems for Class A buildings like those at the airport , hospitals and schools that are designed to withstand a intensity of 8 .
So most buildings in <LOCATION>Chengdu</LOCATION> should still be able to use after emergency assessment , and citizens may go home reassured .
If not so , an investigation should be conducted for any jerry - built projects .
If large sums of money have been spent to provide protection , yet it fails to work when the earthquake comes ,
such that nobody dares to live at home , is able to use hospitals , or accesses airports , then has the money been thrown for nothing ?
Probably some would say the national building criteria for earthquake resistance was enacted in recent years , and older buildings may not comply with the requirements .
However , at the same time the government enacted the earthquake resistance criteria , it required all existing buildings which did not satisfy the criteria to be reinforced and removed of dangers in a timely fashion .
Thus one cannot shirk responsibilities on excuse that it is an old building .
In addition , the government also has criteria for earthquake resistance and prevention for rural buildings .
The earthquake in <LOCATION>Sichuan</LOCATION> stuns everyone .
Elementary school buildings collapsed , and children were buried in the rubble .
Middle school buildings collapsed , and young students were buried under the crumbled walls .
Kindergarten buildings also collapsed , and little children 's frail bodies fell helplessly next to the crumbled walls where they closed their innocent eyes forever .
We could n't help crying at this sorrowful scene .
Children are the flowers of our motherland and future of our motherland .
These flowers of life died early in a natural disaster .
Natural disasters cannot be predicted , but the school buildings should not have collapsed .
Why are the buildings behind the school buildings still there while the school buildings where children studied collapsed from the first floor to the fourth floor leaving only crumbled walls ?
Children , you should n't have departed like this .
Every year , all levels of People 's <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> are held from local governments to the <ORGANIZATION>Central Government</ORGANIZATION> .
Deputies to the People 's <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> , please make an all - around inspection of school buildings in all areas and inspect whether or not the school buildings in your constituencies are up to local earthquake - resistance standards , and then quickly make a proposal according to the existing problems and push each level of the government to complete rectifications and improvements within a limited time .
Special legislation in the <ORGANIZATION>National People 's Congress</ORGANIZATION> on construction of school buildings should be proposed .
There needs to be special legal procedures for the design , materials , construction , completion , and inspection of the school buildings to ensure that top priority be given to quality and durability .
Allowing all children to study safely is the sacred and bounden duty of the People 's <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> .
In <DATE>June 1976</DATE> , 83 year - old <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> had already been revived once after suffering a myocardial infarction .
To get effective care for his condition , the <ORGANIZATION>Standing Committee of the Political Bureau</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>CCP</ORGANIZATION> established a special treatment team , in charge of his medical treatment and care .
The <ORGANIZATION>Political Bureau</ORGANIZATION> also specifically assigned people to the task of <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> 's medical care , taking turns with the doctors and nurses to be on constant vigil at his living quarters .
On the day of the <LOCATION>Tangshan Earthquake</LOCATION> , i.e. <DATE>July 28th</DATE> , those on duty at <LOCATION>Mao Zedong</LOCATION> 's quarters were <ORGANIZATION>Wang Dongxing</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Wang Hongwen</PERSON> , and <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> 's confidential secretary , <PERSON>Zhang Yufeng</PERSON> .
In the early hours of the morning , with the clock hands pointing to 3:42 , the ground of <LOCATION>Zhongnanhai</LOCATION> suddenly started to shudder .
In <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> 's residence , the glass window in the foyer door rattled uncontrollably , and there was a huge bang from below like a tractor starting up , with <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> 's sickbed shaking non - stop .......
While <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> was convalescing , the employees and medical staff around him were all in a state of high tension , maintaining extremely silent surroundings and atmosphere .
In normal times , apart from the talking and noise of medical instruments when the doctors revived him , not a whisper could be heard .
After the nineties , state - owned engineering enterprises stopped recruiting construction workers .
But that is n't to say they stopped hiring people , but those they took in were all graduates with professional diplomas from polytechnic schools , technical colleges , and universities ; these staff all went into management .
During the early nineties , the formal employees of this enterprise still had complete working teams , such as bricklaying teams , woodwork teams , steel reinforcement teams , and machinery maintenance teams , but since they could not cope with a large volume of project tasks , they were already cooperating with some migrant worker units , in other words the familiar " contracting gangs " .
A collision occurred between tradition and reality .
Due to formal working units no longer taking on young employees , working units got increasingly older and broken up .
Some staff ( extremely few ) entered management .
A few exceptional former team leaders gradually became project managers .
Others became materials officers , safety officers and quality control officers , etc.
Those without connections became staff monitoring the construction site ------ similar to the security guards of today .
The workers no longer formed complete operating teams .
And at this time , migrant worker units gained an opportunity to develop .
The entire on - site operation work was all carried out by contracting gangs .
Working units disbanded .
The status of these workers was also changing .
The corrupt mentality that treating dinner and gift - giving is necessary for getting things done is deeply rooted in the minds of people from all walks of society .
In each case of corruption , those power - wielding bureaucrats , those scholars or technicians who have cornered the market in their fields , those capitalists with vast wealth , they are the ruling force of this society , and also the ones who profit from the corruption .
The powerless , pennyless working public with no access to information technology resources % PW are the ones who lose out from the corruption .
Today 's society is corrupt in every direction , and the direct cause is the reinstatement of private ownership and the scrapping of the public supervision of the <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> era .
In privatized societies , everybody tramples over others trying to maximize their own interests .
Doctors who do n't receive ' red envelopes ' have no motivation to properly cure the patient .
Teachers openly ask students to give them gifts ,
gang ringleaders use cash to have the media make them out as heroes ,
capitalists trying to annex state - owned property team up with scholars and academically demonstrate state - owned monopolies to be the reason behind corruption , and then reap in the profits .
Frequently the public , under the guidance of the mainstream media , only concern themselves with administrative and judicial corruption ; this in itself is a type of corruption .
Do commodity prices have a base value worth talking about ?
Do commodities have a true value ?
These are already elements of uncertainty .
With things , less is more ; sell as much as you want , as long as somebody will buy .
In fact , in a socialist country one cannot act in that way .
In the area of profiting from commodities , there have been no systems in place and no legal provisions ever since the reforms , there is no last word on how many multiples of cost profits are allowed to be , or what percentage .
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's self - sufficient , natural economy was not without any advantages . At least it did n't try to reap large profits off its own people ,
now the exact opposite is the case .
A home appliance - whether you are Chinese or a foreigner , which regional category you fit in , whether you are a big city or a small city , whether you are a worker or a peasant - is always the same price .
Not knowing how much profit is in there , not caring who can afford it and who ca n't , these do not seem to be the principles of socialism .
And with farmers ' grain and rural products , if the country does n't wipe out agricultural taxes and does n't offer any subsidies , keeping on producing is a problem .
In order to improve the people 's living standards , the government set things so that grain is always the same price whether sold to big cities or to rich people .
With this kind of ratio in existence , in struggling areas trying for a comfortable life is very difficult .
This issue should attract the close attention of economists .
<DATE>December 26 , 1975</DATE> , <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> had his 82th birth day , his last one .
Upon turning 80 , <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> felt apparently that he was old and would die soon .
Therefore , around his birthday those few years , <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> had always talked about life and death from time to time .
One thing he often said was : " 73 and 84 are ages at which you will be gone even if the <ORGANIZATION>King of Hell</ORGANIZATION> does n't call you . "
Also since he turned 80 , people had been paying more and more attention to <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> 's birthday .
Within the country , people dared not celebrate his birthday publicly , so they would celebrate quietly at home .
Local governments dared not present gifts to <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> , but would convey their blessings to <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> in various ways .
In the years before <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> passed away , his hometown Hunan would specially send things like long life noodles on <DATE>December 26</DATE> every year .
For this , <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> had accepted with pleasure , which was quite unusual .
Despite <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> 's status as the globe 's most financially endowed high - tech leader , bargaining with <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> is something that is sure to leave you greatly disillusioned .
<ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> 's dictionary has never contained the word " generous " .
So when the <PERSON>Jerry Yangs</PERSON> hope that by bargaining they can bump up <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> 's purchase price , they are being very unrealistic .
Microsoft raising its price ever so slightly already represented a big concession , proving that it really does want to get its hands on <ORGANIZATION>Yahoo</ORGANIZATION> ! .
Ultimately choosing to give it up was obviously a very painful decision for <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> .
Right from the start , this was a super acquisition that lacked bite ; despite the numbers being huge , even if the acquisition was successful , truly revolutionizing the framework of the Internet was simply not possible .
However , when the acquisition did fall through , it was also quite disappointing .
To us global observers watching the bustling scene , giving up the acquisition was like a play stopped abruptly halfway through , without ever getting the chance to watch the rest of the fun , and indeed there was no shortage of theatrical transformations .
We have no choice but to return back to our mundane lives , and wait for this increasingly passion - destroying industry to come up with the next affair of note .
Since <DATE>last September</DATE> , when his daughter was diagnosed with symptoms such as bloody feces and kidney stones , <PERSON>Zhou Jin</PERSON> has been in succession to Yongzhou in <LOCATION>Hunan</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Hebei</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Xiamen</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Guangzhou</LOCATION> , and more to take his daughter to hospitals for treatment , but the child 's illness has continued to improve and decline .
This <DATE>September</DATE> , <PERSON>Zhou Jin</PERSON> , working in <LOCATION>Shenzhen</LOCATION> , took his daughter to the <ORGANIZATION>Shenzhen Children 's Hospital</ORGANIZATION> for examination and treatment .
The results of the examination are that the upper rectum was severely infected and the right kidney expanded . The kidney stone found in previous hospital treatments was not found this time .
<PERSON>Zhou Jin</PERSON> said that his daughter , a little over two years old this year , had eaten <ORGANIZATION>Sanlu</ORGANIZATION> milk powder for over a year . Last <DATE>September</DATE> after the bloody feces appeared , family members took his daughter to the Yongzhou hospital for examination . The doctors informed them that " there is no better treatment method , just have her drink more water . "
Worrying about his daughter 's illness , <PERSON>Zhou Jin</PERSON> asked the county hospital to issue a certificate to transfer her to another hospital , to let his daughter go to a better hospital for treatment .
The hospital <ORGANIZATION>Medical Administration Department</ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON>Zhou Jin</PERSON> that issuing of the certificate to transfer to another hospital would require the approval of the <ORGANIZATION>Ministry of Health</ORGANIZATION> , and more than one month would be needed .
" I went repeatedly to find the relevant health department , but they passed my case back and forth . I was helpless and could only take my daughter to the place where I work -- <LOCATION>Xiamen</LOCATION> , to carry out treatment . "
Have to suffer this pain .
The doctor in charge told us that the kid would be out of danger if he could just urinate .
Getting him to urinate could n't be more difficult !
This urine is more valuable than gold .
He did n't pee at all during the first two or three days in hospital .
We were all desperate at that time .
The hospital already arranged for him to undergo dialysis surgery .
And my satisfying son finally urinated .
Out of danger at last , but one trouble passed and another one took its place , there came an acute diarrhea and fever , he was stooling several dozen times every day , you can imagine the suffering .
He had just danced a circle around the Grim Reaper , and encounted this problem on top of that . I was really worried he would n't pull through .
I do n't know what was happening with the injection treatment at the hospital - the more they injected him the worse the diarrhea , nothing would stop it .
After a few more days of treatment , the kid 's diarrhea was a little better and the doctors got him to do an ultrasound .
The kidney stone had been washed out by the medicine . There were no more stones on his kidneys .
The hospitalization was very expensive and our family could n't afford it , so we had no choice but to leave the hospital and go home .
On the night of <ORGANIZATION>Dragon Boat Festival</ORGANIZATION> he passed out a stone by himself , it was a sedimentary one .
The whole family was really excited , we all thought he was better , that he was cured .
Over 200 Han pupils in 15th primary school in <LOCATION>Urumqi</LOCATION> were injected , * and there were actually Uyghur students from the same schools involved * , it was shocking !
On the day of <DATE>September 1st</DATE> alone , at the entrance of " Longyuan Supermarket " on <LOCATION>Urumqi</LOCATION> 's Friendship Road , two people were injected and sent to hospital .
On the same day , in <LOCATION>Shuimogou District</LOCATION> , No. 106 Bus had just pulled up at the Gaojiazhuang stop when several people were injected , soon , the Uyghur assailants jumped from the bus and fled , but they were soon detained after bystanders gave chase .
The 920 and many other buses also experienced a number of poisoned syringe cases .
On <DATE>August 31</DATE> , the No. 17 bus exploded near Xibei Road , while the No. 14 bus was bombed at the same time .
Nevertheless , all news was blocked .
But witnesses shortly after spread the news to the outside world by telephone - <LOCATION>Urumqi</LOCATION> security is extremely deteriorating !
Even more ironic was in <DATE>late August</DATE> , when * President <PERSON>Hu Jintao</PERSON> * had just visited <LOCATION>Xinjiang</LOCATION> on an inspection tour . Upon his return to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> , the situation in <LOCATION>Urumqi</LOCATION> was far from settling , instead the * Uyghur terrorists * becoming even more rampant , and the numbers of attacks and bombings were increasing rather than decreasing !
The incompetence of the <LOCATION>Xinjiang</LOCATION> government would make the Central extremely troublesome !
Listening to Yesterday Once More by the Carpenters , seeing the photograph album in which photos showing collages of compatriots receiving awards , I do n't know when people should cry , and my heart is lost .
After so many years can they still sing Yesterday Once More ?
Dear friends , let me fill in some of the words for the melody right now in my heart .
Do n't worry , the cold - blood is n't me , it 's a part of my heart .
If an Olympic Games were held taking the damage done to mankind by industrial pollution as theme , I think our dear motherland should be able to win a gold medal and a champion of winning the grand total in gold medals . I just do n't know how the opening ceremony would be run , how volunteers should be recruited , or which song should be sung lustily .
The title of the sick man of <LOCATION>East Asia</LOCATION> once went far away following the revolutionary course brimming with victories , but after seeing this group of photos , I feel that they have whistled back with this brand new attitude of faster , higher , stronger .
What is different is that I dare not expect for ; in what way can we have again " The Destruction of Opium at <LOCATION>Humen</LOCATION> " with " upholding the country 's interests with one 's life " .
Because we and our motherland cannot depart from this shocking pollution . What we can do is just to improve , adjust and vaguely hope .
The people who have been sacrificed have , without choice , used their lives to pave the road to success for another group of people .
At that time , tens of thousands of city youth headed to the countryside , but by no means were all of them were true believers .
Some were under pressure to show their " revolutionary zeal " , others went because there were no jobs in the city .
The poverty and backwardness of the countryside were appalling , and most of the educated youth became disillusioned .
In the middle of the <DATE>1970</DATE> 's the intensity of the Cultural Revolution waned , and one after one the youths returned to the cities or went to study in university , but back then there was n't an exam to get into university , it depended on your political background and behavior .
Jianguo was not one of these . He worked for seven years in a rural part of Inner <LOCATION>Mongolia</LOCATION> , became a village head , and was very popular with the locals .
He was a dab hand at working the fields , and could match the locals when it came to drinking spirits .
He married an old school friend of his from <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> , and she stayed behind for him , the two living their own little lives together in the country .
Although the villagers had no interest in the various kinds of " revolutionary practices " that <PERSON>Jianguo</PERSON> tried to make them adopt , he was honest and kind , and his generous personality won their friendship and affection .
After <PERSON>Jianguo</PERSON> had returned to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> for not even a few moths , the student movement in <LOCATION>Tiananmen</LOCATION> began .
Jianguo went to the square to listen to speeches and singing , and watched a new generation of students be rebellious , and was shaken and moved .
Twenty years before , the god of the " Red Guards " was Mao , but the ideal of young people now was wearing jeans and a T - shirt , and a new statue had been erected : Lady Liberty .
At that time I lived in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> , and every day went to the square . When we ran into each other , <PERSON>Jianguo</PERSON> did n't say much . However it looked like he had a million thoughts stirring in his heart .
One afternoon , I went to see an active figure in the square , and arranged to go together with him .
Friends greeted me with smiles , and asked me to go into their tent , as a meeting of student leaders was going on inside .
Jianguo was just behind me and had just started to come inside , when my friends frowned and stopped him : " No , you ca n't come inside ! "
I explained , saying this was my brother . My friends listened with surprise .
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> - born and <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> - raised <PERSON>Jianguo</PERSON> , he looked today completely like a villager from the countryside .
Wang Peirong thinks that this is related to blockages in the usual reporting channels .
He pointed out , all of his reports were made under the circumstances that the normal reports did n't work , and he had no choice but made reports online .
A typical example is that the fall of <ORGANIZATION>Dong Feng</ORGANIZATION> , the most debaucherous secretary labeled as one - husband - with - two - wife in the country .
Wang Peirong thinks that <ORGANIZATION>Dong Feng</ORGANIZATION> 's absurdity and corruption was actually an open secret , but nobody investigated and penalized ; and even though <PERSON>Wang Peirong</PERSON> reported on this using his real name to the concerned departments for one year , no one bothered to inquire about it .
Wang Peirong also thinks that reporting online is equivalent to publicizing the corruptive deeds of the person being reported against . Once under the public eye , the possibility of any blatant cover - ups becomes greatly reduced , thus , making it easier to investigate and penalize .
Many people will ask , <ORGANIZATION>Chargeback Rival</ORGANIZATION> is made by an individual , so what is the relationship with 360 ?
There are likely three original reasons why 360 uses a person 's name to issue Chargeback Rival :
General manager <PERSON>Zhou</PERSON> has done too much bad stuff on PC 's , and did n't want to offend too many people on cell phones , so he found an individual author to act as a scapegoat ( if a cell phone SP company knew that it was 360 that block their way . Each one of them is tough . ) ;
Using an individual author to issue it , it was easy to defraud the grassroots netizens of their sense of identification and sympathy .
If you see I am an individual netizen , who has been charged money , so makes a piece of software in order to help everyone solve this problem , then how moved it seems from the outside .
Using an individual author to issue , there has been a strong power of captivation . Many companies in the SP and wireless realm would definitely think that a product from an individual author would not have much influence , so would not pay too much attention to it .
Nevertheless , 360 already did this under cover of promoting <ORGANIZATION>Chargeback Rival</ORGANIZATION> in large scale . Once after <ORGANIZATION>Chargeback Rival</ORGANIZATION> became dominant on the situation , then it is to be transformed into 360 .
Having seen no hope from <ORGANIZATION>Xu Ming</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Wang Peirong</PERSON> then could only post the relevant problems online .
Not only that , <PERSON>Wang Peirong</PERSON> 's generous and courageous endeavors have led to revenge from the reported on numerous occasions : when reporting the corruption of <PERSON>Li Rongqi</PERSON> , he was severely beaten up by hired goons ; when reporting the black forces , he was retaliated by the black forces , and hospitalized for the injuries .
But these have not been able to halt the momentum of <ORGANIZATION>Wang Peirong</ORGANIZATION> 's reporting .
However , in the program , <PERSON>Wang Peirong</PERSON> calls out to the parties and the government to set out policies and provisions to protect the personal safety and legal rights of whistle blowers .
This program of <ORGANIZATION><< News Night Banquet</ORGANIZATION> >> on <LOCATION>Jiangsu</LOCATION> TV 's city channel , caused a great uproar in the community .
But in contrast with this , <PERSON>Wang Peirong</PERSON> , well reputed as <LOCATION>Jiangsu</LOCATION> 's " number one person in online anti - corruption " , is now suffering unfair treatment .
Because of pressure from the reported officials such as <PERSON>Li Rongqi</PERSON> , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>University of Mining and Technology</ORGANIZATION> has suspended <PERSON>Wang Peirong</PERSON> 's teaching duties .
How <ORGANIZATION>China University of Mining and Technology</ORGANIZATION> responds to <LOCATION>Jiangsu</LOCATION> mainstream media 's positive and active appraisal of Wang Peirong ; how well they treat Wang Peirong ; and how they protect <PERSON>Wang Peirong</PERSON> 's legal rights , are unavoidable questions placed in front of the <ORGANIZATION>Mining University</ORGANIZATION> 's decision makers .
The Chinese defense budget for <DATE>2012</DATE> is RMB 670.274 billion , increasing by RMB 67.604 billion and <PERCENT>11.2 %</PERCENT> compared to the previous year 's estimated budgetary expenditure .
The Chinese military expenditures are increasing too fast for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , and the increase is currently over RMB 100 billion , but what on earth can <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> do with this additional amount of more than <MONEY>RMB 100 billion dollars</MONEY> ?
Based on the current exchange rate between the Renminbi and <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> dollar , it amounts to more than <MONEY>US$ 10 billion</MONEY> , which can purchase more than a hundred of the latest 3.5 generation Western fighter planes .
If it is used to manufacture Chinese J - <DATE>10</DATE> fighters , over two hundred planes can be produced , or perhaps even more . In one go , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> can improve its prowess in the air by a margin even greater than the total sum of a mid - sized Western country .
In fact , what <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> really fears is not the increase of military expenditure , but rather the rapid rate at which <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is upgrading its military technologies , which may enable <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> to overtake <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> soon .
Compared to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has many inadequacies , for instance , its high technology development is not as mature as <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's , and its basic infrastructure , the standard of education of its citizens , development of its systems and so on are also lacking . However , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has its own natural advantages , and that is <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> possesses a long history and stability of culture .
Some people pointed out in their comments that this is a serious disadvantage to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> when compared to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , as they say that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is carrying too heavy a burden which will hinder rapid development ,
in fact , this reasoning is extremely incorrect , the Chinese culture is profound , so whatever problems the country may face , it can draw on its historic experiences ,
for instance , when <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> deals with international affairs , it can learn from how the Yuan Dynasty handled foreign trade and the problems of co - existence between multiple ethnic groups , or it could at least draw a lesson from the negative experiences .
Currently <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is drastically cutting down on its military expenditure , however it fears that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will substantially increase its military expenditure . America is desperately attempting to return to the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION> as it wishes to continue to contain the growth of Chinese military strength ,
<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> controls the Straits of <LOCATION>Malacca</LOCATION> , and a large majority of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's shipping vessels are under its control . However if <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> wishes to maintain the development of world trade order , its expenses will naturally be enormous .
If it were not for the financial crisis , a number of Western countries have stated that they would not have considered budgetary issues for American military deployments .
As a matter of fact , neighboring countries need not be too sensitive to the sharp increase in Chinese military spending . They fear that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will pose a direct threat to them , but Chinese history has shown that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has never had the habit of wielding its military might to challenge Western countries , but as for how they habitually view <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will depend on the profound influence of the Chinese culture .
China does not like to show off , preferring to restrain itself , and the same is true in the field of military matters .
Up to now , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> revealed that it has three models of the 4th generation stealth fighter planes under research and development , and the J 20 is expected to enter mass production and service next year , which is a direct blow to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> ,
however , what is even more terrifying for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is that this Chinese fighter plane model has already displayed surprisingly advanced performance during combat , and it is feared that its level of technological advancement cannot be matched by the F 22. After all , this model of fighter plane has never participated in actual inspections up to this point .
Perhaps this is understandable for <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , but it is inevitable that the 4th generation Chinese fighter plane would create a stir .
The original order has been disrupted . After all , the Chinese fighter is no less powerful than the American one .
According to American media reports , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's military expenditures are expected to reach <MONEY>US$ 200 billion</MONEY> in two years ' time ,
Of course there is a strong possibility that this number has been greatly exaggerated , and it is also embellished by the <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> Threat theory . However , such moves by <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> no longer has much effect on <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , even if the Chinese defense expenditures reach <MONEY>US$ 200 billion</MONEY> , <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> cannot do anything to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> ,
Recently , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> adopted an aggressive stance , casting negative votes on the <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> issue three times , and in relation to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 's naming of the <LOCATION>Diaoyu Islands</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> appears to be sending a message that ' we have accumulated sufficient power , and we are not afraid of your distortions of the truth . '
The Chinese military expenditures are soaring . By contrast , <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is continuously cutting down on its military expenditures , repeatedly asserting that its prowess will be replaced by small but elite troops that will not affect its capabilities . As it is nothing more than self - consolation , therefore , it caused widespread concern throughout <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> .
Certainly , this is clearly a refurbished version of the ' military threat theory ' from <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , and it is now changed to a ' threat by military expenditure theory ' , however , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is used to finger - wagging and criticism from <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , and as <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> grows increasingly confident , this writer believes that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> will terminate its friendly economic relations with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> soon or later ,
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's soaring military expenditures imply that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is reluctant to be limited to a position as the world 's No. 2 , and nor is it content to be world No. 1 in name only . Instead , it intends to recover its historical 1,500 - year glory as the leader of the world .
The content is not quite the same as the title ...
Let me whisper this : Doing business in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> depends on connections , and red packets are also accepted ~ same as in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> ... :)
Faced with rascals and hooligans like the Americans , the Chinese have no choice but to arm themselves .
Indeed . I wonder what our military expenditure is like in proportion to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's , and besides how much of our military expenditure is genuinely spent on sophisticated national defenses , if it is really spent on advanced defenses , there will never be such a thing as too much ! Compared to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> we are still lagging far behind !
Now that Vice President Xi has visited <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , the direction for the Sino - American relationship has become the focus of world attention .
But no matter how sweetly imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> talks , I have no hope for imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> .
Imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has always been a country failing to live up to its words , and as long as something is in its interests , it will spare no effort and use any means to get it .
The relationship between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is like that between the sheep and the wolf , and do n't expect the wolf to change its ambition ,
he wolf and the sheep can never be friends , even if so , it 's only an illusion on our part , it 's only a wolf in sheep 's clothing .
Ultimately , it will reveal its wolf nature , and I hope the sheep will not be fooled by it .
The whole world expects <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to coexist peacefully , jointly preside over and deal with international affairs , and build a peaceful new international order .
The peaceful coexistence of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is also the common wish of the people in the two countries .
Nevertheless , the peace we aspire to will be only our good wish .
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is the fallen petals that have the intention , but imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is the heartless flowing water .
Maintaining friendly relations with imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is only the wishful thinking of some Chinese !
Though there is a great distance between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and there are no territorial disputes , unlike our relationship with the Polar Bear , there is a direct conflict of interest .
However , due to ideological difference between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and the lack of the necessary trust and communication in handling international affairs , it is particularly imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , in its effort to contain the development of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and its threat to its hegemonic position , that makes trouble wherever possible to constrain the takeoff of the Chinese dragon .
Actually , imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has the initiative in terms of whether the two major countries , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> can get along ,
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has done a lot , and sacrificed a lot , for the Sino - American relationship ,
ut of its wishful thinking , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> uses its warm face to caress the cold ass of imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , but it is still unable to win imperialistic <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's sincerity , causing the Sino - American relationship to waver and even fall backwards .
In future times , as <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> challenges its world hegemony and imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> attempts to retain it , more clashes will happen , conflicts will be inevitable , and the struggle will become ever more ferocious .
In recent years , as <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's reform and opening - up campaign has reached greater depths , the people 's living standards have improved substantially , and its defense and military strength has also developed rapidly .
The status of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> as a major world power has begun to be more prominent , and in dealing with and directing international affairs , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has played an ever more important role .
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's rapid growth and rise has gradually threatened and challenged the hegemonic position of imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> .
This makes imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> restless , and it has devised every possible means to contain and check <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's development .
Imperialist America wants to upset and restrain <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> with its military sales to <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> issue !
The <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> issue has become an everlasting sorrow in the hearts of all descendants of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
Imperialist America wants to control the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> and suppress <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> mainly because it covets the important strategic location and abundant resources of the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> .
Imperialist America wants to overthrow the Bashar regime to get rid of the Polar Bear 's only military base in the <LOCATION>Middle East !</LOCATION> It does not want the influence of the Polar Bear to exist in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> region over the long term .
Imperialist America wants to topple <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> mainly to take on <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , to control <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's resources and contain <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's development .
In addition , it also wants to suppress the Polar Bear and squeeze the living space of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> .
In today 's world , the only countries that can constitute a threat to the hegemonic position of imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> are <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and , to a lesser degree , the Polar Bear .
Imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has had far - reaching strategic foresight , and each step it takes serves to consolidate its hegemony .
Imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is suppressing <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in an all - round way , and we can see imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's meddling presence in the economy , politics and military affairs .
Imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has been supporting little <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> , the Philippine servants and the Vietnamese monkeys , disturbing the stable environment around <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> to disrupt the peaceful development and rise of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
Imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is now pompously returning to the <LOCATION>Asia Pacific</LOCATION> region and reshuffling its military deployment , directly targeting <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
<LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> is the deepest pain for all Chinese , because imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has long taken <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> as a pawn and used it as a bargaining chip in the struggle with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
It 's a pity that many Chinese are still hoping to make friends with imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and maintain a friendship with imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> from generation to generation .
Furthermore , the many strategic adjustments and ideas of imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> are all aimed at the rising <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
Many advanced weapons have been tailor - made for <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
Compatriots ! Wake up ! Imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has already aimed its guns to our heads , do not keep daydreaming !
Imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> takes <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> as its prime rival and enemy , give up your fantasy that you can make friends with the enemy !
The best method is to make good use of our time to step up our own defense and military construction , cast away all the illusions , and get ready for war !
Our ancestors wisely said , " Harbor no ill intention against others , but never relax one 's vigilance " !
This is the necessary psychology for getting along with friends , but at this moment imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is our enemy staring like a tiger watching its prey , making it more necessary for us to remain vigilant at this time !
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has made a lot of sacrifices to improve its relations with imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has all along tried to become friends with imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> ,
although <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> now needs a peaceful and stable environment for its development , we ca n't make continual investments without any return .
Can Sino - American relations be improved ? Is friendly development possible ? The key question lies with imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , not <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
Imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has always held the initiative in the development of Sino - American relations .
In fact , it is not difficult for <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to become friends , because <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , despite their ideological differences , have no land or territorial disputes .
Though <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> have fought each other on the battlefield , the wars were not directly between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> .
If imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> sincerely wants to make friends with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , it must display its sincerity and let the Chinese people see actual actions and results .
For <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , the greatest interest concerning imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> lies in the <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> issue .
If imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> can stop its military sales to <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> , provide no support to <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> , and ensure peace across the <LOCATION>Taiwan Straits</LOCATION> , it will allow <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> to accomplish its great cause of national reunification .
If it refrains from meddling in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's internal human rights issues , and also does not intervene in other affairs such as <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> , I believe that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will also sacrifice its other interests to reciprocate the good faith of imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> !
Only if imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> does this can <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> truly become friends and co - exist peacefully as friends from generation to generation .
Will imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> give up <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> ? Absolutely not !
Being used to being a hegemon , imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> likes to intervene in the internal affairs and human rights affairs of other countries , and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> is the best chess piece for containing <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , so I believe imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> will not easily let go of it !
There is even less possibility that it will tolerate a Chinese challenge to its position as the world hegemon !
In the years to come , instead of becoming friends , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> will only become rivals and even enemies !
Therefore , it 's unnecessary to harbor any fantasies about imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> should fundamentally change its mentality , there is no need to fear imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , and we should be ready for a military confrontations with imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> at any time .
Let 's win the respect of imperialist <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and the whole world with our strength .
A peaceful rise is only our unilateral notion , because the big powers of the world will not accept the appearance of a powerful <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
Only baptized by war can <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> really become a world power .
The Chinese should be ever vigilant and not be deceived by the present peace , active war preparation is the only right choice ,
nly when our defense and military have become strong , will we be able to eradicate all aggressors , and only through the baptism of war can <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> become a truly powerful country .
In my personal opinion , there must be a war between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in the future !
What <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> needs to do is to cast away its illusions and get ready for war .
China Mobile is no doubt a monopolized operator in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , the biggest mobile phone market in the world . It has also expressed clearly its ambition to step outside the country and participate in global competitions .
Even though the performances of Chinese companies are not outstanding in the course of globalization , <PERSON>Wang Jianzhou</PERSON> , President and CEO of <LOCATION>China Mobile</LOCATION> , is determined to change all this .
On the eve of the Business Week CEO Forum held in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> on <DATE>November 1</DATE> , <PERSON>Wang Jianzhou</PERSON> gave an exclusive interview to the editor of the Business Week .
He stated that the objective of <LOCATION>China Mobile</LOCATION> is to become a world - class company .
<PERSON>Wang Jianzhou</PERSON> , 57 , said in fluent English that <LOCATION>China Mobile</LOCATION> , which is listed on the <ORGANIZATION>Hong Kong Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> , has close to 300 million mobile phone users in mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , an equivalent of the entire population of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .
This signifies that <ORGANIZATION>China Mobile</ORGANIZATION> occupies almost <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of the market share in mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
<PERSON>Li Yanhong</PERSON> , <PERSON>Zhang Chaoyang</PERSON> , <PERSON>Shen Nanpeng</PERSON> , <PERSON>Ma Huateng</PERSON> ...
In the past 10 years , behind these Chinese high - tech magnates who emerged one after another was sure to be the shadow of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> owned <ORGANIZATION>International Data Group</ORGANIZATION> ( IDG ) .
The annual IDG Conference was held in <LOCATION>Sanya</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Hainan</LOCATION> on <DATE>November 3</DATE> .
Apart from the seven partners , who are called the ' Seven Swords ' inside IDG , the participants also included over 190 CEOs of companies that <ORGANIZATION>IDG</ORGANIZATION> invested in and representatives from investment banks and consulting agencies .
According to the practice of the past six years , after each <ORGANIZATION>IDG</ORGANIZATION> conference , there will always be some participants who make the list of magnates of the year .
I insisted on not paying him . Finally , he cracked and fled in panic .
However , I was also at the verge of collapse because the people 's police at 110 whom I looked forward to still had not arrived yet .
These days , overseas study has become popular . To friends and relatives , it 's a proud thing to be mentioned .
Children of the rich and government officials , who does n't want to enhance their status through overseas study ?
Let alone that getting oneself a western diploma will make getting a good job easier in the future . Even old dad and mom making a parade of it everywhere would look exceedingly good !
However , those in middle class families or even laid - off workers see those children of the wealthy and powerful go overseas , come back cloaked in glory and all have a good future ( they do n't know that family wealth and good backgrounds of those are the only real guarantees ) . How wonderful ! Thereupon , they pinch and scrape to send their child overseas ,
It seems that once they are sent overseas , nothing but a wonderful future and unlimited glory will return .
Nowadays , it is more often the case that those who do n't pass the university entrance exam and are wasting their days at home without doing anything are sent overseas . With a bit of " toughening up " , everything will be okay .
Wrong ! With a huge chunk of cash spent , the frightening thing is that the payoff falls far short of expectations .
Even more frightening is that it holds the child back .
I 've been in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> for several years !
What I have experienced myself or , even more , what I have seen are the countless who have given up their studies year by year , those with wrecked health everywhere , those who sold their souls and even those who lost their lives .
Overseas study is a splendid term , but in return it demands youth , effort and staunch perseverance , as well as sufficient rationality .
Life is never a bed of roses in any location , even more in a foreign land where there is a language barrier , different customs and no family or friends .
Malformed society
The proposal on " the transfer of reproduction rights " is originate from the same track the proposal on " controlling the number of rural children going to college " ! What else are these representatives if not do - nothing politicians ?
Fuck you ! Go to hell ! Fuck your mother !
Complete and obvious bullshit ! More sinister than directly selling and buying infants !
Can <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> still be saved ?
The one - child policy is the most insidious policy , thoroughly antihuman and racially discriminatory , an open trampling on the right of survival right for Han people as a whole . Those who formulated and implemented this policy are all fascists ; they should be brought to trial at the <ORGANIZATION>International Court</ORGANIZATION> , and the people principally responsible for it should be hanged .
This guy really is a " representative " , a - ha .
As known to all , <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> have very low birth rates and mainly depend on migrants to maintain their population sizes and keep their populations young ; there is good economic development ;
In recent years , due to labor shortages , millions of black people and Southeast Asians have come to the southeast , and have caused varied degrees of deterioration in social order .
Just like <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> depends on immigrants and at the same time pursues the one - child policy , making the planning policy look like a very clever policy !
<LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> maintain their social development by absorbing migrants from other provinces , what will happen if <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> prepares herbal medicine by the prescribed method and absorbs foreigners ?
Do n't wait till the situation has become unmanageable and then drive away the gypsies as <PERSON>Sarkozy</PERSON> did ; German Chancellor <PERSON>Angela Merkel</PERSON> has just recently declared that <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> has failed to build a diversified society and will limit the development of the immigrant population ; now that the sheep have been stolen , no choice but to mend the fold !
Before long , the dividends for the population would wear out . As immigrant laborers swarmed in ( these people are not subject to family planning ) , the population would soon experience racial replacement , and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , as <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> did , would soon disintegrate !
The blacks , Arabs , and Vietnamese , one after another , would demand their rights , autonomy , and independence !
One after another , the local areas would become independent , as <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> did !
The minority peoples in <LOCATION>Xinjiang</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> can bear more children , causing the proportion of the Han people compared to the population of the frontier ethnic regions to decline quickly ;
The regiments of troops and Sichuan women that such national heroes as <PERSON>Zuo Zongtang</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wang Zhen</PERSON> took great pains to transplant into <LOCATION>Xinjiang</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> are being quickly exterminated by the one - child policy ; the undercurrents of <LOCATION>Xinjiang Independence</LOCATION> and Tibetan Independence are getting ever more rampant !
The family planning policy and the one - child policy have put the country in an dangerous as stacking eggs , and posed a threat to the survival of the nation .
Family planning has effectively reduced the Chinese population by 300 million , postponing the Day of 7 Billion by 3 years ; According to the plan of the <ORGANIZATION>Planning Commission</ORGANIZATION> , even if the Chinese population is reduced by <MONEY>1 billion</MONEY> , the Day of 7 Billion will be postponed for just another few years !
But the Chinese nation will be on the brink of extinction . Such selfless notions which nobody will have until evolving into a nonhuman creature , surprisingly , has become a reality in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> !
The issues of population and ethnical structure are major issues for the survival of the country !
Family planning is part of the plan to massively exterminate the Han people , and the beginning of dividing <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> !
The family planning policy is extremely stupid and the ultimate in self - castration . It is unprecedented from a historic perspective and will be unmatchable in the future ; and in the global perspective , it is totally unique !
The self - harming policy fully embodies the malice of the enemy and the stupidity of the those in power , brings disasters to both the country and the people , is totally void of conscience , contributes nothing to the contemporary time , leaves a legacy of trouble for a long time in future , and will definitely become a joke that those throughout all history will ridicule !
The other day , <PERSON>Xinwen Lianbo</PERSON> reported that the difficulty for enterprises to hire workers has extended to the west and swept the whole country !
The family planning policy is extremely stupid , brings disasters to both the country and the people , and is totally void of conscience !
<ORGANIZATION>Improving Population Quality Requires Transferring Reproduction</ORGANIZATION> Rights to the Rich ?
Through free exchanges on the market , nearly everything can be bought and sold .
Today , the right to bear a second child is also becoming a popular product with the rich .
They have money to buy the right , to bear the child , and to raise the child .
As to these transfers and transactions of the right to bear a second child , let 's have a look at how the representatives argued and legally struggled with government officials at the " Two Meetings " .
Why did they propose such a transfer on the right to bear a second child ?
To this question , <PERSON>Li Xinghao</PERSON> - the author of this proposal , <ORGANIZATION>NPC</ORGANIZATION> representative and Chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Zhigao Group</ORGANIZATION> , said that such a transfer is beneficial to improving the quality of the population .
Transferred to which kind of person , exactly ?
This representative identified 3 groups : First , people with strong educational backgrounds ; second , the rich class ; third , civil servants .
Li Xinghao asserts that " In today 's society , people with strong educational backgrounds , the rich class , and civil servants have relatively high social status , relatively good economics means , and can ensure basic educational conditions and a good environment for the newborn population to develop in " .
Why is such transfer practical ?
Li Xinghao gave his own specific explanation from the angle of market supply and demand .
He said , " For a transfer , people are not classified into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not .
He said that the original motive for this proposal was rooted in his discovery that some families legally allowed to bear a second child , due to their poverty and other reasons , would become even more impoverished if they were to do so ;
while some rich families had a strong desire to bear a second child but did not have the allowance to do so .
He thinks that this conflict really exists , and the relevant governmental departments can take the initiative to establish a transfer platform . "
This transfer proposal by Representative Li is indeed very smart .
On the one hand , it helps the government to reduce and narrow the gap of wealth ;
n the other hand , it also solves the structural conflict of the reproduction right market - the poor have allowances but cannot afford the birth and upbringing , while the rich want to bear children but do n't have the allowance .
Based on Representative <PERSON>Li</PERSON> 's proposal , the rich will voluntarily reduce their per capita wealth by bearing and raising more children , while the poor will increase their per capita wealth by bearing and raising fewer children .
Through such transfers and transactions of the right to bear a second child between the rich and the poor , the government can unnoticeably narrow the ever - increasing gap between the poor and the rich without spending a single cent .
How can the wealth gap be narrowed through such transfer ?
This Representative Li has envisioned a fast track for the get - rich - first people to guide and assist the get - rich - later people . That is , " the allowance transferee shall give the transferor ' an entire sequence ' of help and support . "
" According to <PERSON>Li Xinghao</PERSON> 's plan , through lottery - type drawing , the transfer platform establishes a one - on - one guidance and assistance relationship between the transferee and the transferor .
As part of the assistance , the couple applying for the allowance to be transferred in to them will buy the transferring couple all the basic insurances currently required by the government , including social insurance , medical insurance , and personal accident insurance , and will continue to provide them with a minimum living guarantee for the rest of their lives .
Meanwhile , the applicant couple will also provide financial support for the education of the transferring couple 's child until he or she graduates from university .
What 's more , if the transferring couple intend to register as permanent urban residents , the applicant couple shall buy them a 35m2 socially subsidized apartment in the city where the applicants dwell , but all of the transferring couple 's land use rights in the countryside will belong to the applicant couple . "
What do our family planning officials think of this proposal that the State " utilize the transferring of rights to bear a second - child to improve the population quality and make the get - rich - first help the get - rich - later so as to realize common prosperity " ?
In response , " Yesterday , <PERSON>Zhang Feng</PERSON> , Director of <ORGANIZATION>Guangdong Provincial Family Planning Commission</ORGANIZATION> , made his stance clear to the media that the right to reproduce is absolutely not transferrable .
In the event that the right to reproduce is transferred , it would not only be a violation of law , but also bring moral questions if it involved a transaction . "
Through transferring their right to bear a second child and the concomitant obligations imposed on the transferees , the poor can get rich with the guidance and assistance from the get - rich - first class , if the proposal can pass and become law , the poor undoubtedly have found in the rich class , well - educated class , and the bureaucratic class an obedient son to provide for them up until they die . Marvelous indeed .
He claims it is not a transaction , but how can it be otherwise ? In this bundle of obligations for common prosperity , where is the dignity of the poor ?
Does not the bundle of obligations proposed by this Representative Li still imply a contract on the exchange and transaction of land use rights ?
Certainly , without such exchange of interests , why would the rich take an interest in providing for the children of the poor ?
If the legislature really wants to adopt this proposal on the premise of the get - rich - first class leading the get - rich - later class to become rich by giving them one - on - one guidance and assistance so as to improve our population quality and narrow our wealth gap , it must ensure fairness in such exchange of interests and during the transfer .
Transferred together with a wet nurse .
Following it with interest .
For a transfer of the right to marry , people are not classified into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not . Since I discovered that some men who have a legal right to marry , due to their poverty and other reasons , would become even more impoverished if they did marry ;
while some rich men have a strong desire to marry N concubines ( because their mistresses often fuss about wanting to get married ) but they do not have the allowance , and would be guilty of bigamy .
I think that this conflict really exists , and the relevant governmental departments can take the initiative to establish a platform to transfer the right to marry .
Pillaging the flesh till the bones are seen ?
Interesting ... interesting
Logic of hooligans .
Directly transfer the wife
A pack of luxury cigarettes ranges from as little as a few tens of yuan to more than a hundred yuan , if you smoke a stick , you are puffing away one month 's salary for an ordinary worker .
If it was bought with public funds , it may be said that what they are smoking are not cigarettes but the " blood and sweat " of the taxpayers .
NPC Representative <PERSON>Ma Wenfang</PERSON> proposed that consumption of tobacco products on public expenses should be universally banned .
There are of course many reasons as to why we lag far behind in meeting our tobacco control objectives .
But one of the undisputable reasons is that a huge smoker 's group exists within our huge contingent of civil servants .
Among this legion of smokers , a considerable number smoke " free cigarettes " which they do n't have to buy with their own money , as they were received as gifts or bought with public funds .
It is precisely because they are not using their own money that they usually smoke luxury cigarettes which are unaffordable for most people .
Their track performance for blowing smoke rings also has a compounding effect in repeatedly setting new records for consumption expenses by civil servants , and it has become an organic portion of officialdom corruption as a whole .
It was precisely this horrifying social backdrop that prompted <ORGANIZATION>NPC</ORGANIZATION> Representative <PERSON>Ma Wenfang</PERSON> to solemnly set forth her proposal that consumption of tobacco products on public funds be universally banned .
In our country , there are many civil servants who think their family name is " Gong " and such that every expense incurred by them , regardless of whether it is for public or private purpose , should be borne by the public . Therefore , consumption on public expenses can involve almost everything imaginable .
For instance , besides luxury cigarettes , other examples include luxury liquor , fine wining and dining , luxury cars , and overseas tours , and whatever luxury enjoyment and extravagant entertainment they can imagine , they would want to have them all and enjoy them to fullest , using public funds to settle the bill in full .
If the supreme authorities had to draw up separate regulatory documents to address every single item for consumption on public expenses for nationwide circulation in order to check such extravagances , the mountain of documents will really extend towards the sky .
In fact , all that needs to be done is to clearly include tobacco products within the anti - corruption regulations ' relevant clauses for prohibition of consumption on public funds , and it will suffice .
As for the remaining issues , we must ensure that the orders and prohibitions are fully enforced . If any civil servant dares to violate the law , he will be severely punished according to the law and regulations .
If this was really carried out in all localities at every level , there would be no cause to worry that the corrupt practice of consumption on public expenses , including smoking on public funds , cannot be curbed .
After deputies and committee members have moved into their quarters in the hotel , how would service staff greet them ?
Some greet them with " Deputy So - and - so " or " Committee Member So - and - so ; " while some call <ORGANIZATION>NPC</ORGANIZATION> deputies " chief , " which makes some deputies , especially deputies from the grass - roots level , feel somewhat embarrassed . Some deputies even request service staff to " not call me chief . "
Calling deputies and committee members who have moved into their quarters in the hotel " chief " is , of course , out of the hotel service staff member 's formal respect , but it has actually caused misunderstanding of the identity of deputy or committee member .
As major national events , the convening of the two conferences has clearly provided the path ahead for our development .
However , at the two conferences , according to common sense , the identity of " deputy " or " committee member " is generally used , that is , " Deputy xx " or " Committee Member xx . " But I cannot say much for the mention of " deputy as a chief . "
Through the subtlety of greeting , we can see common people 's sense of awe towards " deputies " and " committee members . "
Actually , when providing services to deputies and committee members , what 's wrong with being a bit simple ?
Would n't it appear more cordial to directly greet them as " Deputy xx " or " Committee Member xx ? "
After greeting them as chiefs , do n't you have a sense of awe and awkwardness ?
As deputies , they should equally treasure their own first identity . Deputy or committee member is neither an administrative official post nor a honorary title . This identity means enormous responsibility .
At the " times of the two conferences , " deputies and committee members should have an even heightened sense of responsibility . No matter what kind of social status you yourself have , remember firmly your own first identity and most important identity is a deputy , a committee member .
This is just a tidbit at the two conferences . The conferences that follow will unfold more exciting contents in front of us .
They are scumbags
Gosh , they even dare to use the word ' awe . ' Common people could n't wait to ' despise ' them , how could they have a sense of ' awe ? '
What would you say , which thingy there is publicly elected by common people formed by the first , second , and third person such as you , me , and him ?
Before the two national conferences were convened , various major news websites and periodicals across the country in succession invited netizens and readers nationwide to submit " suggestions for the two conferences . "
This writer from " suggestions for the two conferences " submitted by netizens across the country on various major news websites on the central government 's strengthening of efforts to oppose corruption and promote honest government , better supervision of the government and officials , and severe punishment for people engaged in embezzlement and corruption .
When <ORGANIZATION>CPPCC</ORGANIZATION> delegate <PERSON>Mao Xinyu</PERSON> checked in to attend the " two conferences " and spoke of a motion he proposed this year , he said the emphasis was on anti - corruption efforts .
The anti - corruption drive involves everyone , from the ordinary people below up to and including the delegates to the two conferences .
At present , public expenditure on food and entertainment nationwide has already reached 300 billion a year .
Such a huge figure for public expenditure on food and entertainment crowds out expenditure on things vital for people 's welfare , including education , hygiene , healthcare , and social security .
Figures listed in a bill drawn up by the <ORGANIZATION>Jiusan Society</ORGANIZATION> 's central organization before the two conference in <DATE>2012</DATE>
are really unbelievable : annual public expenditure on food and entertainment actually reaches 300 billion ! How large is this figure of 300 billion ?
If we saved this 300 billion and invested it in the economically undeveloped and impoverished regions in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , how many schools could we build ?
How many poor families could we assist ? How many children forced to leave school could we assist ?
It 's a pity that this <MONEY>300 billion</MONEY> is squandered with no results , wasted in the pursuit of debauchery , by corrupt officials - How could our people not hate the " parasites " hidden among the membership ranks of the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> ?
When corruption among government officials is brought up , the ordinary people all gnash their teeth , but the ordinary people are , after all , the ordinary people , and can only look on helplessly in silent fury .
The ordinary people cannot afford to upset government officials , for if the ordinary people dared to upset government officials , they would be cracking eggs against rocks . Not only could they get more than they bargained for ; if something went wrong , they could end up in prison , or even endanger their lives .
Every year , there are cases across the country where ordinary people , because of reporting government officials , suffer the disaster of imprisonment if they get up lightly or the disaster of death if they are dealt with harshly .
It is common for ordinary people , with no other means of redress , to post on the Internet out of resentment against savage land requisitions or the savage demolition of homes and forced relocation by local government officials , but what fate do they often bring on themselves ?
Local government officials easily pin some labels on you , and you can even be chased and arrested by public security bodies across provincial boundaries .
The most terrible thing is not the government officials , but the power that lies in the hands of these officials .
How can we prevent the " three types of consumption on public funds ? "
If we are to prevent the " three types of consumption on public funds , " we must first " block " the officials ' mouths ,
but this is easier said than done . Why ?
As people working in a lower - level work unit , if leaders from higher - level work units come , do you dare not to entertain them in the most respectful way with nice things to eat and drink ?
If they are not entertained well with nice things to eat and drink , after they 've gone , will officials in the lower - level work unit still have a future ?
To their subordinates , senior leaders are all their " masters . " You ca n't afford to upset any of them , and whoever upsets them is in for it . If you rub them up the wrong way when you 're trying to butter them up , you wo n't just jeopardize your official position , you wo n't even know what the consequences will be .
To stop the " three types of consumption on public funds , " senior officials must first " block " their own mouths .
In <DATE>April 2011</DATE> , when the no. 6 inspection group of <LOCATION>Hubei</LOCATION> 's provincial party committee went to <LOCATION>Yichang</LOCATION> city on an inspection tour of Zigui county , a national - level impoverished county , the local government officials were both delighted and worried .
What delighted them was that they had an opportunity to report their problems to senior leaders and have them taken seriously by them , and what worried them was that there were 13 people in the inspection group , coming for 20 days or so , and the entertainment expenses , the cost of the gifts , and the inspection fees and various other items of expenditure would altogether come to 801,900 yuan .
How could this national - level impoverished county pay the bills ?
This example is the best illustration that if we are to prevent the " three types of consumption on public funds , " we must first stop the senior government officials .
If the upper beams are correctly placed , the lower beams will not go awry .
If the central state authorities are to stop the " three types of consumption on public funds , " they must dare to do what they mean .
It should be said that wining and dining on public funds as pointed out by scholars is an objective reality .
With the increasing prevalence of the alcohol culture at the grass - roots institutions , alcohol has already been fermented and adulterated by the so - called " bureaucratic culture " beyond recognition .
Some people put on high - end wine banquets trying to please their superiors , some people use alcohol as gifts to seek personal gain , some people consider it a type of pleasure to get people to drink by using beer games , and some people get carried away because of their addiction to alcohol or drunkenness , adversely affecting their work .
Every year the amounts of food trashed and money wasted as a result of wining and dining on public funds are even more appalling .
This writer has lived for a long time at the grass - roots level and often heard and witnessed some grass - roots officials almost sitting at meal gatherings or attending banquets every day , and never getting tired of it .
How much is the wining and dining expense at the grass - roots level in one year ? A specific number is virtually never published .
Actually , the insiders are well aware that this is a considerably high expenditure .
Who should be blamed for the grass - roots officials ' wining and dining becoming common practice ?
Speaking with regard to the grass - roots levels , it is indeed necessary to conduct rectification and to straighten things up according to the relevant regulations , but focusing on the grass - roots levels alone may not be enough .
Throughout the year , various types of inspection groups and investigation groups , as numerous as the hairs on an ox , come and go in an endless stream , also making the grass - roots institutions overburdened . Some grass - roots leading cadres , with no choice but to run between the various dinner parties every day , also feel somewhat helpless .
There are also many people wallowing in the array of wine glasses and poker chips becoming " vessels for wine and bags for food . "
This writer met with some township officials . Facing more and more dinner parties , many of them are fed up with it , but also feel forced and helpless .
The reasoning they explained is that entertaining is just for solving problems .
A township official , using his fingers to count , told this writer that in order to solve financial , road repair , canal construction projects and so on , they must entertain the relevant personnel and department heads , otherwise it will be of no avail .
When I look back to all these years , the urban construction in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> has experienced rapid development .
Some people said that it borrowed the easterly wind of the Olympics . However , I think otherwise .
Even though the <DATE>2008</DATE> Olympics allowed <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> to display its charisma in front of cameras of all caliber that frocked in from all sides ,
it has almost been four years since the Olympics and the urban development in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> still has not stopped .
Speaking of urban development , the most representative one is none other than the <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> subway .
Those who were born and raised in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> in the 80s can almost be called the generation who grew up sitting on the subway .
The public transportation then could not be considered as convenient compared to now . Buses could hardly be said as providing easy access to all directions .
However , with their extensive coverage , the two subway lines provided novelty and convenience to many <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> residents and visitors who travelled from afar .
The subway is a distinguishing traffic feature of <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> . As one of the first Chinese cities to have underground transportation , the emergence of subway has provided everyone more choices .
This underground railway line that runs through eastern and western <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> has become <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> 's symbol of alternative culture .
Day by day , <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> is developing , so are its public transport and highways . Eventually , it will usher in the alarming data of 5 million cars in <DATE>2012</DATE> .
Meanwhile , the crowded highways and complicated road traffic cause people to have greater expectations in the development of the subway .
I have to applaud the continuous increase in the efforts in subway construction of <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> in all these years when I talk about subway development .
In <DATE>July 2001</DATE> , with the success in the bid to host the Olympics , <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> subway Line 13 also ushered in the completion of the entire line and became the newest member of the <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> subway family .
Meanwhile , in <DATE>October 2007</DATE> , the closely watched subway Line 5 went into operation . It became the new trunk that links southern and northern <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> and intersects with Line 1 .
While <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> residents enjoyed the modernization of subway Line 5 , in <DATE>July 2008</DATE> , the first phase of construction of subway Line 10 and in <DATE>September 2009</DATE> , subway Line 4 and Line 8 all became operational one after another . At the same time , all suburban districts and counties are all connected by the subway successively .
In about 10 years time , the <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> subway transformed from an underground supplementary means of transport that only had two lines to a 15 - lined underground transportation network that covers almost the entire <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Changping</LOCATION> in the north to Daxing in the south , Mentougou in the west , and <LOCATION>Tongzhou</LOCATION> District in the east .
Such rapid development was almost unimaginable by anyone and unachievable by any country .
While <DATE>2012</DATE> is quickly approaching , there is even the spectacular scene of four lines opening at the same time . It is veritably " putting all firepower into operation " !
The rapid coverage of underground transportation has brought along prosperity to surrounding communities of the subway . Residents no longer have to worry about which bus route to take when they go out .
More residents gladly choose to travel by subway . It is both convenient and cozy .
Needless to say , the subway has brought about convenience to the travel and work of the residents . More commendable is that the convenient subway has allowed more residents to give up their cars and choose such green means of transportation that is environmental friendly .
Not only does a reduction in cars on the road alleviate traffic pressure on the road ; it also reduces the pressure of air pollution so that more residents can cheer for the blue sky of <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> from their heart .
These are all contributions of the subway . Yet , where did the contributions of the subway come from ? They were naturally from the rapid development of the subway in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> within these 10 years .
The development of the subway is the same as the rapid global development of the city of <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> , it will become a permanent city symbol of <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> and a benefiting project that earns the satisfaction of the residents and the respect of the world .

It can be said that the elections that cover five major cities have stirred up a storm in <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> .
In the midst of all this commotion , <PERSON>James Soong</PERSON> made a sudden appearance to come head to head with <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou in the elections .
This made the already worried Ma Ying - jeou even more anxious , but there is nothing he can do .
This is linked to the earlier stand mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> made regarding military cooperation with <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> . In addition , <PERSON>James Soong</PERSON> has expressed clearly that his taking part in the elections is to tell <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou that he had worked hard to get the <DATE>1992</DATE> Consensus from mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Ma</ORGANIZATION> should not let everyone down .
Regarding the chaos in <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and the future ultimate unification of mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> , what else do we still need to face ? What else do we have to do ?
Regarding the " weathervane " of <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou 's stand , what other preparations should we make ?
<PERSON>James Soong</PERSON> 's transfer of allegiance is to force the undecided <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou to declare his stand on the ultimate unification
<PERSON>Soong</PERSON> 's transfer of allegiance is , in a certain sense , a kind of response to mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's intention .
On the issue of mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou has gotten a lot of room for maneuvering ,
from playing the <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> independence card for the sake of the elections to playing the card of attacking mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and achieving military balance for the sake of the elections . However , on the issue of the ultimate unification of mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> , not only did <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou fail to make any progress , he even took a big step backward .
In the past , he was standing close to the middle . Now , he is starting to gradually follow the footsteps of the <ORGANIZATION>DPP</ORGANIZATION> . He keeps pushing the bottom line of mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> for the mere sake of manipulating the elections . Furthermore , he completely ignores the compromises made by mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the effort it has put in for peaceful unification .
To save the Taiwanese economy , mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has made huge policy adjustments such as absorbing <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> 's excess industrial capacity , buying <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> 's excess agricultural products , giving several Taiwanese political figures room for international affairs to carry out international affairs , etc.
However , after all this waiting , in the end it has to face <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou'a a double - headed snake that is seemingly false and real at the same time .
Therefore , facing this undecided <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou , <PERSON>James Soong</PERSON> stepped up to defend mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> !
Is n't Ma Ying - jeou wanting to score more points for his selection ? Is n't he wanting to elevate his position through manipulating the people ?
The moment <PERSON>James Soong</PERSON> appeared , the situation changed ! This is to force <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou to stop manipulating the elections and declare his stand on the ultimate unification of mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> !
Ma Ying - jeou is <LOCATION>Not Mainland China</LOCATION> 's Only Choice , <LOCATION>But Mainland China</LOCATION> is Going to Be <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou 's Only Choice
So , what cards is Old Ma left with to play ?
Military purchase - fetus died in the womb ;
economic development - eclipsed by the prosperity of mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> ;
culture - fully integrated with mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> as well ;
as for military affairs - Taiwanese soldiers , whether ex - service or in service , are all under the control of mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's military departments .
As for the key Taiwanese figures who hold military power , mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has long ago convinced them with reasons .
Fellow countrymen should not slaughter one another , and brothers should not turn against one another - this makes the Taiwanese military less hostile towards mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
As for the withdrawal of missiles proposed by <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou , it is also no longer an issue now .
So what is <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou still waiting for ? For a major change to take place in <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> ?
To mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou is no longer mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's only choice .
Mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is actively seeking all forces in <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> that can be sought . Even the <ORGANIZATION>DPP</ORGANIZATION> is starting to change its course .
However , <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou , who is holding on and keeping his mouth tight , has no other choices except mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , in other words , mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is Ma Ying - jeou 's only choice .
Basically , all the big bosses of the Kuomintang have visited mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and even received VIP treatment , getting all the respect they deserved .
So , is <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou thinking about his future position or the great cause of the national unification ?
Ma Ying - jeou might offend some people in <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> who are eager to achieve <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> independence , but <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou can gain the respect of the entire Chinese population of 1.4 billion . Comparing the two , it should be clear which is important and which is not .
When <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> visited <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> back then , he turned the Sino - American relationship around . So , does n't <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou want his name to go down in history ?
Could it be that being the bill of a chicken is really better than being the anus of an ox ?
Hence , <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou should understand that he is only one of the choices of mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> . It is up to him whether he wants to achieve success and acquire fame .
Watch out for <ORGANIZATION>Ma Ying</ORGANIZATION> - jeou 's Continued Military Resistance against Unification by the Lease - to - own method
Though the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has recently increased its military presence in the <LOCATION>Asia Pacific</LOCATION> region , it is showing a rare undecided stand on the <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> issue .
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is no longer able to tell where <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> is heading , because all Taiwanese senior politicians are talking about unification and there is less and less talk about secession .
Furthermore , a certain tacit agreement between mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> regarding the <LOCATION>Diaoyu Islands</LOCATION> has made the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> feel somewhat unable to do what it wants to do .
However , some people from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> are still somewhat intelligent .
They no longer talk about military purchase but started proposing a lease - to - own method for <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> to get weapons .
The weapons <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> has now are old .
The lease - to - own method might bring some advantages in conducting cutting - edge military confrontation with mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , but fundamentally speaking , <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> no longer has the strength to fight against mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
If it continues to take its old path of resisting unification through military forces , then it will meet a very tragic ending !
Diaoyu Islands Will be a Touchstone - <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> Can No Longer Turn Back
Of course , there are still many opportunities for mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> . For example , the <LOCATION>Diaoyu Islands</LOCATION> is the first touchstone of cooperation between mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> .
When it comes to the <LOCATION>Diaoyu Islands</LOCATION> , mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> can jointly deploy naval vessels , jointly defend the <LOCATION>Diaoyu Islands</LOCATION> , and join hands in fighting <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> .
Recently , within <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> , active actions have been taken concerning the ownership of <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> as well .
For example , there have been active changes as to how the <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> issue is treated , how the historical issue of the resistance war is treated , and how the issue of <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> as part of mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in the past is treated .
It is these changes that made the entire <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> , from top to bottom , reach a consensus that it can survive by staying close to mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
Facing mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's offensive efforts towards unification , <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> can no longer turn back .
<LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> will become another traitor if it goes into <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 's embrace . Only by going into mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's embrace will <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> have a bright future !
In short , <PERSON>James Soong</PERSON> is merely someone through whom mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's stance ranging from active cooperation to slight warning is demonstrated .
If <PERSON>Ma Ying</PERSON> - jeou does not want to oversleep after going back to bed in the <TIME>morning</TIME> , he must truly face what the people of both sides of the Strait have been hoping for for a century !
It is up to him whether he wants to be a sinner of the nation or a meritorious contributor to the nation !
When that time comes , the people of mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will respond enthusiastically to Ma Ying - jeou !
What 's going on !
Damn , these people who do n't learn to be good should rot at home . Why are they coming out ?
Endangering the society !
Really , one should not be a Samaritan
If you help the other person get up but she does not appreciate it and even pushes you , then you should not help her anymore .
Yet you help her again ...
Do n't tell jokes at the seaside . It will trigger tsunami
It is really too tragic
Meeting violence with violence does not benefit anyone
Woes of the society .
Those who make trouble after getting drunk should be punished without leniency . Detestable
The following is a quote from Qiuyeyuanmaoerkong from the second posting :
The perpetrators are not going to be held responsible just because they said they are poor ! ? Who dares to be a Samaritan in future ! ? ...
It is really tough being a good person .
The old man was looking for trouble ...
Nowadays , there are many scumbags around ~
The following is a quote from * Miyamiya * from the seventh posting :
Nowadays , one should not do evil , but one should not do good , either
Damn , nowadays one should not be a good person
" The society always makes you feel painfully scared . Every day , there always seem to be countless reasons that make people curse ! "
This is well said ...
This is what you call unforeseen misfortune
People say , do not do good things . He did n't listen ... sigh ,
Scary
The following is a quote from <ORGANIZATION>Ninth Inspiration</ORGANIZATION> from the tenth posting :
What 's going on ! Damn , these people who do n't learn to be good should rot at home . Why are they coming out ? Endangering the society ! ...
Why did n't they get knocked down by a car and die after getting drunk ? Scumbags !
The following is a quote from zhukong81 from the 16th posting :
Woes of the society ...
Good people are beaten into extinction just like this , they 're all done for
Right , you 're so old , why did you go and help a young man up ... It 's tough to be a good person
It 's tough to be a good person
Never be a good person ... Always remember ...
If severe punishment is not given , in future everyone will pretend to be drunk and make trouble

A Letter from the Victim 's Family
First of all , I would like to thank a kind - hearted person for calling the police immediately . I would also like to thank the public security authority for the prompt capture of the perpetrators .
Early in the <TIME>morning</TIME> on <DATE>September 1</DATE> , my father , as usual , was riding his bicycle to Gucheng Park for exercise . At Jiuli Street , he saw someone lying on the side of the road , and so , out of kindness , he went up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon . Then , three people ran up to him , kicking and beaing him ( according to the police , they had drunk four cases of beer at the time ) . As a result , my father 's skull suffered serious injury . He bled profusely and lost consciousness . By the time he was taken to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated . However , with prompt rescue given by a doctor , he survived . As there was serious bleeding , the doctor performed a life - saving surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father 's head to remove blood clots . Due to profuse bleeding , some of the blood had already flowed into the brainstem and bottom of the brain , putting his life in danger .
Right now , my father is in very serious condition . On <DATE>September 1</DATE> , he underwent a 5 - hour craniotomy . On <DATE>September 2</DATE> , he had a tracheotomy and a respirator was used to help him breathe . Currently , he is still unconscious . After these few days of hospital treatment , he is sometimes able to move his arms and feet , and he is showing signs of recovery .
As his children , we feel very terrible now . It has been six days since the incident . Under the police 's advice , the perpetrators finally gave 10,000 yuan . We have already delivered the money to the hospital . Now , almost 50,000 yuan has been spent on the medical bills . We do n't know when we can get money to pay for future medical bills .
We have now already received a payment reminder from the hospital . If we do not pay on time , the hospital will stop supplying medications . When that happens , I cannot bear to think of what will happen to my father .
Our family has very poor living conditions . My mother only gets a minimum welfare pay of 380 yuan , and she has diabetes . My father is a retired coking plant worker . His pay is also just a bit over 1,000 yuan . I am doing odd jobs at a factory , and I have not even made any medical insurance or pension contributions . My elder sister is also an odd - job worker . She has also not made any pension or medical insurance contributions . Furthermore , I am going to be a father soon . I have a very heavy family burden . Our family now can only rely on my father 's pay to survive . We absolutely cannot afford such high hospital costs .
It has been six days since the incident . As victims , we have the rights of a citizen to know some things :
1. Where are the perpetrators from ? How are their family and financial conditions ?
2. When can the case be submitted to the procuratorate ? When can public prosecution be initiated ?
3. We hope the perpetrators can cooperate actively and take practical actions to work together to first save my father 's life .
4. We request to meet the parents of the perpetrators .
We hope the news media can help us to jointly save the life of my kind - hearted father .
We also ask the government departments to coordinate with one another and be flexible to activate my father 's medical insurance card and save his life .
After the court verdict is out , all medical costs will be paid back to the medical insurance bureau .
A million thanks to the city residents and media for the concern they have shown us in this incident . May all you kind - hearted people have a life of peace !
Victim 's son
Why helped him up when he was sleeping happily ?
Faint . The social morality system is about to collapse . Everything must be torn down and start all over again . Sigh
Manhunt . Post the pictures of that bunch of perpetrators !
Tragedy
What a turbulent society
Nowadays , to be a good person is really not something you can do casually
Hope the perpetrators can assume the responsibilities
Nowadays , to be a good person is really not something you can do casually . Hope the perpetrators can assume the responsibilities
Sentence all of them to life imprisonment and let 's see if they are going to pay
Poor old man . He 's still stuck in the era of learning from <LOCATION>Lei Feng</LOCATION> . The society today is a mess .
It 's tough to be a good person !
It 's tough to be a good person !
Punish severely ! It looks like we have to mind our own business !
It is legal as long as three hours of sunshine can be achieved .
Most high - rise buildings with a spacing of 100 meters can certainly achieve that .
Three hours of sunshine , from <TIME>morning till night</TIME> , can certainly be achieved .
Most sunlight issues raised by the elderly men and women are indeed not against the national requirements , so they 're merely unreasonable complaints of the elderly as a result of their perceived discomfort .
Even if there is a court judgment confirming that the developer is not against the law , they will still persist with their unreasonable demands .
Reply to Light - and - shadow - hero on the 10th floor :
Three hours of sunshine is a technical term . Sunlight analysis is needed . Setbacks of spacing are related to not only the sunshine spacing but also the floor thickness . A sunshine spacing coefficient of 1:1.4 can meet the requirement for three hours of sunshine on the day of Great Cold in <LOCATION>Taizhou</LOCATION> . All we want is that the developer does the job legally , and makes it clear that sunshine analysis has shown that the minimum national requirements can be met !
But what you said is also somewhat reasonable . The minimum standards are not acceptable to most people . They have a good reason to ask for more sunlight . However , this developer is too strong . We just want to secure the minimum legitimate interests according to the national regulations , but even that is so difficult for us !
Guanxi and operations , alas .
I remain poised
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> : There are too many issues now ! Is that because good officials are too few ?
Developers always want to make more money . We have a building here , which has not been pulled down so far even after exposed by <ORGANIZATION>CCTV</ORGANIZATION> . How powerful the developers are .
The following is a quotation of All owners of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 's words on the 1st floor :
All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in <ORGANIZATION>General Secretary Hu</ORGANIZATION> 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer ! ...
Uh ... Do you have legislative power or enforcement power ?
In <LOCATION>Zhenjiang</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Jiangsu</LOCATION> , an old man doing morning exercise helped a drunk man up and was mistaken as a thief and badly beaten up
Five young men who work as chefs at <ORGANIZATION>Zhenjiang Hotel</ORGANIZATION> were strolling on the street in the early morning on the 2nd after downing several bottles of beer .
One of the men , Ji , squatted on the stone step of a bus stop .
<PERSON>Mr. Yang</PERSON> , an old man from <LOCATION>Zhenjiang</LOCATION> who is in his 60s , was passing by while on his morning exercise . After seeing that , he asked Ji to go home soon , and then held out his hands to help Ji up .
However , Ji mistook <PERSON>Mr. Yang</PERSON> for wanting to steal his things , so immediately together with Wu and Ma , he battered the old man violently till he was seriously injured !
Murderers all go for the head !
I think they meant to kill him !
Latest news : Victim <PERSON>Mr. Yang</PERSON> passed away around <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> on 9/13/2011 . Perpetrators remain under criminal detention .
However , this incident has not yet come to a close . The victim 's family may still have to wait for the police to conduct an autopsy on the victim .
Regarding this incident , both sides involved have posted relevant comments in this thread . They are in postings no. 74 and no. 77 .

Latest development
Victim : Old <PERSON>Mr. Yang</PERSON> is currently still unconscious and in critical condition .
The family members of Old <PERSON>Mr. Yang</PERSON> said tearfully that when the old man was being sent to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated . He has been transferred to ICU ( intensive care unit ) after receiving emergency treatment given by the hospital .
The medical costs alone add up to as much as more than 5,000 yuan a day .
Perpetrators : Three men have been criminally detained by <LOCATION>Zhenjiang Jingkou</LOCATION> police .
After the three of them paid 10,000 yuan in total for the medical costs ,
he family of Ma recently again raised 10,000 yuan to pay for surgery .
Hereby , we hope the perpetrators will be able to show resolution in taking on responsibilities and face seriously the mistake that has been committed .
Victim 's family : As Old <PERSON>Mr. Yang</PERSON> is still in a toxic and unconscious state , he is unable to provide information about what happened at the time of the incident .
Though the three perpetrators have paid 10,000 yuan compensation in total , it is obviously not enough to pay for the current medical costs that are increasing sharply by the day .
Furthermore , in view of the criminal detention time limit , can such punishment have a deterrent effect on the perpetrators ?
How about future medical costs ?
The Yang family hopes to get legal and media assistance .
Associated incidents
The moment this incident came out , this writer could not help but recall the " touch porcelain " case that happened two years ago !
Cases like the one where " a vehicle owner who helped an old lady lying on the ground get up was accused of knocking her down " all raised a huge uproar across town .
Sometimes , I even doubt the frequency at which such incidents happen , life is getting to really look like fiction !
The society always makes you feel painfully scared . Every day , there always seem to be countless reasons that make people curse .
Let 's not say much . Let 's pray for the injured and hope the perpetrators get punished .
The perpetrators are not going to be held responsible just because they said they are poor ! ?
Who dares to be a Samaritan in future ?
The important thing is to save life !
Are there any solutions ? Provide legal assistance !
Let the law show its might ~
It takes 30 days before public prosecution is initiated . Even day lilies wither by then ! ~
This is actually not about being a Samaritan or not . Many drunkards have lost their consciousness and will get in a drunken fit .
When you want to help , you have to see who it is . If you ca n't handle , just call 120. Sigh ...
Severe punishment still should be given to those who commit crimes after drinking . If not , it will be chaos if everyone pretends to be drunk and bashes up others .
Nowadays , one should not do evil , but one should not do good , either
Such a cup .
The old man was looking for trouble . He should have kept a distance after seeing those drunkards .
Would everyone agree with illegal construction of high - rise buildings ?
Now , in the hometown of our beloved General Secretary Hu , such a strange thing is happening .
Here is the thing : <ORGANIZATION>Shenzhen Maoye Developer</ORGANIZATION> has come to Hailing District , <LOCATION>Taizhou City</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Jiangsu Province</LOCATION> for urban construction , and is welcomed by our people .
We do not oppose the construction of high - rise buildings . However , the developer is going to construct a high - rise building against the law . That is what we are resolutely opposed to !
Maoye Developer has planned a high - rise building of 150 m in the Julangchao lot of the old East Station , <ORGANIZATION>Hailing District</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Taizhou City</LOCATION> .
Julangchao used to be the eastern suburbs park , for which many of the old Taizhou people have great affection .
Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 is just located at the back of the Julangchao lot , and now Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 is only about 100 meters from the external walls of the original buildings at the farthest end of the Julangchao lot .
How does the developer meet the national requirement for building setbacks based on a minimum sunshine spacing of 1:1.4 in <LOCATION>Taizhou</LOCATION> ?
Aside from the other sunshine shelters , how can the developer ensure a minimum three hours of sunshine on the day of Great Cold ?
It is certainly not feasible if they want to cheat about the 3 hours technically ,
The plain fact is just in front of us . Moreover , are those few entities the only ones capable of doing sunshine analysis in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> ?
We certainly will verify it . A lie will never become the truth !
If the developer can not even give us owners a minimum of three hours on the day of Great Cold in accordance with the national requirement , which has ensured its best interests , how can it give a reasonable and fair explanation to the society , the vast community of netizens and the masses ?
Where are the conscience and morals of the developer ?
We understand that the developer wants to get more benefits , but those are supposed to be legitimate benefits !
On the one hand , such act , if illegally infringing upon other people 's interests , will be detrimental to the reputation and long - term future development of the entire Maoye group . On the other hand , are people whose interests are infringed all fools ?
Will they just let the infringement occur ?
The minimum 3 hours is already difficult to accept . If it is basically an illegal act that makes the fundamental three hours even less , think about it - how will things evolve ?
Finally , the contradictions are bound to intensify , making the situation out of hand .
We hope that the developer can seriously think about this issue , avoid losses and seek its own legal interests through rational development and reasonable development according to law !
If the developer are determined to infringe on our rights and interests , we will surely unite as one to defend our legitimate rights and interests !
The most strange thing is that some people of high rank even agree with the illegal construction of high - rise buildings . We hereby earnestly request the people of high rank who agree with the illegal construction of high - rise buildings to raise their hands and give us a way out !
All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in <ORGANIZATION>General Secretary Hu</ORGANIZATION> 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer !
All netizens are welcome to look into this matter !
Hello , everyone !
Previously , due to issues about the high - rise buildings on <ORGANIZATION>Maoye</ORGANIZATION> 's pre - sale renderings and <ORGANIZATION>EIA</ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>Taizhou Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau</ORGANIZATION> , the young and old of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 were neither sleeping nor eating well . Some were depressed , and some were irritated . In short , we felt very angry .
Now <ORGANIZATION>Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau</ORGANIZATION> has given us a clear answer that those were simply renderings . Upon verification , the <ORGANIZATION>Planning Bureau</ORGANIZATION> has requested the developer to make modification . The <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION> will definitely exercise administration according to law , and never approve anything unless it is legal , reasonable and fair ! A forum and a hearing will also be held prior to approval ! A large stone in our hearts has finally dropped onto the ground .
We are moved that in the face of such a huge benefit , our leaders of <ORGANIZATION>Taizhou Municipal Government</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau</ORGANIZATION> have stood unswayed , showing a very noble sentiment and reflecting the characteristics of the Communists in serving the people , which is truly admirable !
All owners of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 hereby express deep respect and gratitude to <ORGANIZATION>Taizhou Municipal Government</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau</ORGANIZATION> for upholding justice ! People living in <LOCATION>Taizhou</LOCATION> are happy , thanks to the officials caring for them like their parents !
We thank the government for its concerns over people ! We strongly support for the government administration according to law !
All owners , Pengxinlidu Building No. 14

I hope that the developer does not come to compete against us for sunlight . How do we live without sunlight ?
All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in <ORGANIZATION>General Secretary Hu</ORGANIZATION> 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer ! For us ordinary people who are like dog shit in this society , it is ridiculous to discuss whether power or law is superior .
I feel really good about that oh oh
What 's the point of law over power ?
It is the powerful that make the final execution .
Yeah , in the real world , we vulnerable groups really feel at a loss as to what to do so often . The power of developers is too great ,
Some relevant government departments just blatantly give the green light to developers against the law and help them fool people !
So we have to frequently ask ourselves : is the law enacted by this country really useful ?
Is it really capable of restraining developers from grabbing through deceit or by force and illegally obtaining benefits ?
But we can not just watch as the developer take away our sunlight , leaving children and the elderly shivering at home in cold winter . If so , we ca n't live a healthy life , nor can we enjoy the warmth of the sun !
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> had been thinking about invading <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> for a long time . Would it need the assignment from <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> to decide whether to invade <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> or not ? Not to mention that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> only acts against the political system of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> ? Was it still not enough for <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> to be fooled after <DATE>1991</DATE> ?
The weapons market in <LOCATION>South Asia</LOCATION> has been dominated by the hairy country . Though it is weakened by the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> weapons market , however , the Russian weapons market still occupies the major portion .
It is not <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> deliberately making use of countries on the <LOCATION>South China Sea</LOCATION> to besiege <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
Looking at the chaos in the <LOCATION>East China Sea</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>South China Sea</LOCATION> , even thinking with your ass , you will also know that it is the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> rather than <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> trying to cause trouble .
Firstly , <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> is not a country with sea power . It has no interest in intervening and meddling in the issues of the <LOCATION>East</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South China</LOCATION> Seas .
Secondly , at present , with the expansion and extrusion of <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> can hardly protect its own traditional zone of influence . We can say it is busy enough with its own affairs .
And presently , the <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> - <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Military Cooperation</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> are all products of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> 's two - ocean strategy .
After World War I , two systems had taken place . One is the <LOCATION>Versailles System</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> , and the other was the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> - Japanese Washington System in the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> stretches over the two oceans , and controls the two systems at the same time .
After World War II , it took control of the two systems respectively , castrating <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> , and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> staying alone in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> to be hermaphrodites , living on by helping the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> manufacture electronics and automobile products .
And now , the biggest enemies for the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> are such large geopolitical powers in the Old World as <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
While <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and the West have no so - called estrangement in ideology and political system , <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> still continues to expand to the east .
And now the <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> - <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Military Cooperation</ORGANIZATION> is setting up a blockage line and a ring of encirclement around the coastal regions in East and <LOCATION>South China</LOCATION> .
The coup in <LOCATION>Central Asia</LOCATION> has not succeeded . Otherwise , once the ring of encirclement is completed , the northern land will cause a headache to you just as the <LOCATION>East China Sea</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>South China Sea</LOCATION> .
Do you still believe that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> can become a friend of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> as long as it changes its ideology and system ?
The reasons for <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> to ally with <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> are that both <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> need to heal their wounds from after the disintegration of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and with the savage hegemony of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> .
Solving the existing territorial disputes is an important means of realizing mutual trust . Of course <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has made great concessions . There is no other choice .
In fact , unlike <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> has neither the policy of reform of opening up nor a good future ( this precious opportunity was seized by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> at the historical turning point then , while in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , it was ruined by the two idiots at the critical moment . It also shows that the Russians are relatively inferior to the Chinese people in terms of both IQ and EQ ) .
The Russians are bare - footed , so they are not afraid of a <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> with shoes .
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has enough reasons to make concessions to <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> . <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has no fear . <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has many opportunities and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has other approaches .
Although <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> is not our friend , we should not turn it into an enemy .
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> should not be equated with each other .
To the Chinese people , if <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> wantonly killed Chinese people in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's traditional area of activities like <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> did , then in the sentiments of ordinary Chinese people , they would hate <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> as much as they hate <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> . However , they did not .
The only case where they wantonly killed Chinese people happened at the end of the <ORGANIZATION>Tsing Dynasty</ORGANIZATION> . It was the disputable Hailanpao Slaughter .
Thousands or tens of thousands , the number is just a small proportion even compared with the population of the <ORGANIZATION>Manchu</ORGANIZATION> .
It can even be ignored if compared with the Chinese population of nearly 400 million . Can it be equated with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 's massacre of Chinese people in the populated <LOCATION>North and Southeast of China</LOCATION> ?
Besides , <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> is a European country with its strategic focus in the west . The Far East is never its focus .
If the Russians really want to seriously take <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> as their arch enemy , they should strive to construct the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION> .
However , nowadays , with its own serious problems , it continues to abandon the Far East and many cities have become heaps of ruins .
It shows that <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> 's strategic focus has been in the west , addressing the expansion of <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> . Only traitors will be advocating hostile relations between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> here .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> can pose a greater threat and impact upon <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> than <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , especially in the core area of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
The reasons are simple . <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> is a European country . The Far East is not its focus , while the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> is a country in the <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> - <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> region .
Do you know the theory of sea control ? Nowadays , is there more influence from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> in the issues of the <LOCATION>Taiwan Straits</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>South China Sea</LOCATION> and the Far East ? It is the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> ! This is clear proof !
Do you think that territorial waters are n't territory ? In modern times , the strategic and economic values of territorial waters are much more than those of land territories . One can only become a strong power and have a say in the international community by controlling the sea .
Why was it not <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , its neighbor , but instead <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> , separated by vast oceans , that made <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> into a colony ?
Nowadays , <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> has serious problems itself . Its armaments are quite obsolete , and the living conditions for its people are extremely adverse . The population has faced a sharp reduction .
The national elites all know the home country is hopeless , so they all run abroad .
It has become common practice for women to marry foreigners , and many of them come to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and become prostitutes .
Even the productivity of the population is seriously lacking . It is impossible for it to constitute a threat to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
And nowadays the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> is besieging and containing <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> openly with a view of disrupting <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
Why leave the current problems unsolved , but seize on <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , which has no ability to pose a threat to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> at present ?
When it comes to that <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> occupied <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's territory , that is another story like the Japanese did . <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> wanted to invade the whole country of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , but can <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> do that ?
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> is a European country with its strategic focus on the west , rather than the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION> . Its expansion to the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION> in history was also partly non - governmental and partly governmental .
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> is separated from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> only by a strait , with the spacious <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> behind it . There is no menace from the rear if it invades <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> with all its strength . Can <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> do that ?
Even if <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> puts a little bit more energy into the issues of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Far East</LOCATION> , can it ignore the affairs in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> ?
Moreover , we would rather say that <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> has availed itself of opportunities , than to say that it had invaded and occupied <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's territories .
At that time , those places were far away from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's traditional living area . <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's exploration was a little bit later at that time . There have been few inhabitants around those places in history .
At that time , those places were bitterly cold places covered with waist - deep snows . So we pay no heed to them .
Although when it comes to now , these places are of great economic and strategic importance . However , at that time we did n't discover that ; therefore , at that time even the ruler of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> paid no heed to the places , and sent no immigrants there for quite a long time .
Just like today 's oceans . From the perspective of today , they have huge economic values , so territorial waters are also important territories .
However , in the past , they were not discovered . And territorial waters were not regarded as territories . They even exercised trade prohibition on the sea area and closed the coastlines .
Yet the Russians availed themselves of a favorable geological location to occupy those places ahead of us . The Russians were just availing themselves of opportunities .
At that time , it was a time when big powers established colonies everywhere . Unlike today , when the behavior of all countries are bound by international laws .
Other big powers had to capture colonies by war . For example , it was through war that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> occupied <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> respectively .
However , the Russians got such a big place without much effort . That was because the ruler of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> did n't care for the unexplored places .
They just availed themselves of opportunities . Things such as territory are hard to talk about .
If it was your imminent area of activity , it might be justifiable .
However , if it was a place that you did n't send immigrants to explore for a long period throughout history , and was taken by others because of a favorable geographical location and convenient access , then as time goes by it would be hard to say , after a certain length of time .
It would be barely passable for you to claim it to be yours . This is totally different from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> . Can <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> launch a barbaric war of aggression to occupy <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's imminent territories like <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> did ?
Can it provoke * to invade northeast <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and launch an all - out war of aggression against <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> because northeast <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> had become an imminent territory of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> like northern <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> with the arrival and exploration of large number of immigrants from inside <LOCATION>Shanhaiguan</LOCATION> Pass ? It is impossible .
The opinions of the writer <ORGANIZATION>Wuhan Tuo La Ji Shou</ORGANIZATION> on the upper floor are brilliant ! However , by reversing the order of " subjugation of the nation " and " elimination of the entire race , " would it be in line with the historical facts ?
Right now <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> is clamoring " to build <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> into the top military power in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> . " Putin personally sealed the arms sale deal to sell <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> advanced weapons such as aircraft carriers , nuclear - powered submarines , T 50 fighters and BrahMos missiles ... Even the weapons it sells to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> are more advanced than those it sells to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> . And it only sells <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> big airplanes and carrier aircraft . Its wild ambitions are thoroughly exposed !
It is a pity that the present dynasty are national scum supported by the <LOCATION>Soviet Union !</LOCATION> While the yellow Russians are prevailing , what else can the grass - root folks do ?
It seems that all Chinese hate Japanese , and I am not an exception . However , has everybody thought it over that it was <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> who stirred up the war between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> for fear that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> would reclaim territories from it ? It was also <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> that went between the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>KMT</ORGANIZATION> and was able to achieve success one way or the other . And at the end of the war of resistance , it then stirred up the civil war , and lured <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> to get involved in the Korean War . If <PERSON>Stalin</PERSON> was still alive , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> would have more trouble !
Even if it has propped up an agent in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , it is still concerned about <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> . And in the <DATE>21st century</DATE> , it continues to play little tricks of provoking anti - Chinese sentiments . It sold weapons to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and checked and seized the cargos of Chinese merchants . Its crimes are so numerous that bamboo strips would be exhausted before they could all be recorded .
What is regretful is that our government deals with such kind of things in different ways . If the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> does so , <PERSON>Mr. Qin</PERSON> Gang and <PERSON>Ms. Jiangyu</PERSON> would absolutely deliver a so - called just and severe statement of condemnation . Yet with regard to the incident of the Chinese boatmen who were shot by <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , there was not even a protest presented . And it became an incident with no definite results in the year <DATE>2009</DATE> .
The greatest threat of subjugation of the nation comes from <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> . In history , countries being eliminated by this nation were as many as the stars in the sky . Moreover , in the history of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , almost all geographical threats came from the north .
The greatest threat of " elimination of the entire race " comes from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> . The seed of national hatred is indelible . Once discharged accidentally , it would not be just territorial conflicts , but a massacre .
The greatest threat of downfall of D comes from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> . The dramatic contrast of ideology causes the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> to treat all dictating Ds in the world as targets to be removed .
However , there is no need to worry that he would have any claims for territory .
The greatest threat to the economy comes from the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> . The <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> frequently takes the opportunity of trade or human right conflicts between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> to grab a large portion of the market , and squeezes the surplus values . Now it has become our biggest trading partner .
Personally I think the geopolitical environment of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is quite adverse . However , Just as what the floor host said , the real threat comes from <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> .

Do you think nowadays that <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> still has the capacity to do that ?
If the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party of China</ORGANIZATION> does not put the practical interests of the people first , but continues to tolerate the corrupt governments , the people would lose their faith in the <ORGANIZATION>Party</ORGANIZATION> , and in the near future it could hardly be avoided that the territories of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> would be divided by an alliance of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> !
It was foreseeable that they have put their hands into our neighboring countries , and they have instigated pressures on our country from all sides . Has n't the government in power run by the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> been claiming to be strong ? And now it is time for you to bring your wisdom into play ~
The Sino - Japanese war and the civil war of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> were stirred up by <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , and <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> has the ability to force <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> to send troops to <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> ? Nonsense !
For <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> have the biggest relationship in the world , and the Sino - <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> relationship is a trade - off relationship .
In the most recent visit to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> by <PERSON>Xi Jinping</PERSON> , which is an exercise before he becomes the top official in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , the primary topic discussed was mutually beneficial economic cooperation of the two sides .
The Sino - <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> relationship is very complicated . Economically , the two sides are partners on unequal footings ,
politically , it is a relationship between socialism and capitalism ; militarily , Chinese and <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> militaries are in an isolated state .
Therefore , currently <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is playing games with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , i.e. how to offset the latter two relationships with economic cooperation .
Next is a brief analysis of the main strategy of Xi Jinping 's visit to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> :
First , what is the biggest puzzle between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> ?
The biggest puzzle in front of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is how to maintain its relationship with the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> as it becomes increasingly powerful .
To <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , it cannot fall out with the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> .
If <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> falls out with the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> , then it will seriously consumes <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's strengths and will be very unfavorable for future development of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> ,
because <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will lose the situation of peaceful development internationally , such that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has to cope with not only the powerful military threat posed by the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> , but also complicated relations in the neighboring areas . This will seriously consume <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> energy for development .
Therefore , on the premise of not falling out with the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , on the one hand , still has to maintain relationship with the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> , while on the other hand , it has to precaution against the dirty tricks that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> plays on <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
Second , it is not time yet to be tough to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> .
Some believe that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> should be tough to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> . Is the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> someone that yields to hawkishness ?
In the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> era , it got in a race for hegemony against the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> , where both sides were so tough that they became enemies , which provided the US the opportunity to break up thoroughly with the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> .
As the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> does not need the <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION> to exist as a great power , the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> could attack the <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION> and tackle the <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION> without any hesitation .
The road <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is going along at present is one where the two sides are intertwined with each other , such that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> also suffers great loss when attacking and imposing sanctions on <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
What 's more , many businesspeople in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> also come out to oppose the government 's behaviors . <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will be able to truly rise as long as it can keep on for ten years .
As the ancient saying goes , a gentleman can afford to wait for as long as ten years to avenge . If <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> falls out with the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> too early , it will put itself in a very disadvantaged position .
Although we are strong today , it 's not time yet to fight the final battle with the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> .
Third , the two phases that the Sino - <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> relationship will go through .
It is not advisable to fight a major war in the <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's dealings with the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> .
The author believes the two sides could only undergo two phases . The first one is a period which sees <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> grow in strength and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> feel seriously threatened .
The second stage is when <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has become strong , the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> is no longer certain about winning a war with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , such that it has no choice than to cooperate in order to obtain more benefits .
To avoid war between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> , it appears extremely important to carry out exchanges between the two peoples .
Next let 's have a look at survey results of Americans view towards <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> :
An opinion poll of a <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> website shows that <PERCENT>6 %</PERCENT> of the people believe <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> are " allies , " <PERCENT>69 %</PERCENT> think they are " friendly but not allies , " and <PERCENT>4 %</PERCENT> believe they are " enemies . "
Survey results also show that <PERCENT>71 %</PERCENT> of the Americans believe Sino - <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> relations are " very important or somewhat important , " while the proportion is <PERCENT>85 %</PERCENT> in opinion leaders .
On the 14th , the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post said that in an opinion poll it conducted jointly with the <ORGANIZATION>American Broadcasting Company</ORGANIZATION> , <PERCENT>52 %</PERCENT> of the respondents saw <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in a negative way .
This result reflects two urgent issues . First , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is not that bad in the mind of American people , and there is still environment and scope to continue expanding exchanges .
Second , if <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> do not handle their relations properly , lacking in communications between its peoples and the foundation or friendship , then the Chinese and American peoples may turn hostile .
Therefore , the Chinese and American peoples must enhance cooperation and bring the two sides closer through economic cooperation , so as to offset the discrepancies brought by military and politics .
However , it is undeniable that serious conflicts remain between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> in some important areas .
For instance : the <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> issue ; human rights and democracy ; <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> ; <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> ; proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> ; geopolitics and military strategy ; trade and currency ; intellectual property rights and internet spies .
These puzzles cannot be overcome with the two characters of friendship alone . After all it involves major interests .
So it is no secret to the two sides . Just like Vice President <PERSON>Xi Jinping</PERSON> counts on the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> to oppose <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> independence and Tibetan , how could <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> count on a geopolitical enemy ?
National presidents are all masters in politics , who know what 's at stake . However , what should be said should be said . The thing is if the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> has said something , it will break its words if it does n't do what it said , which will show to people in the world that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> is immoral and its words do n't count .
Anyway , between <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> in the future , whoever is a better strategist and whoever comes up with more sophisticated strategy wins .
It requires wisdom to be friends with an enemy . You can only fight a hundred wars without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .
This view tells us a fact that one will earn respect by developing military force
The cannons are thicker
It requires wisdom to be friends with an enemy . You can only fight a hundred wars without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .
Chairman <PERSON>Mao</PERSON> has said a long time ago : one will be beaten if he / she is backward . Only development is of overriding importance !
It is fun ? They are ordering the dog they feed at home to bark at you , yet you have gone to shake hands with them , looking for slaps

Brainwash the Chinese people on behalf of the Americans .
Brainwash the Chinese people on behalf of the Americans .
Is it the American system that 's superior or the Chinese system that 's superior after all ?
I think <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> and the mainland are already distinguishing relative superiority or inferiority between them . The thread starter should take a look outside the country more
You look but not see the ZG 's chaos in society , or is it voluntary blindness !
I also feel that there are more modern " traitors of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> " than during WWII .
Everyone has eyes , look at the living situations of <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> - do you still not understand ?
Venture exchange ,
If I take care of myself , that 's good enough , when the country needs me , I 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness
If these traitors of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> existed around 50 , 60 years ago , they would already have been executed by firing squad .
To make a conclusion , you must have something to demonstrate it
I do n't have time to go searching
I wish LZ would explain them one by one ...
Their property and families are all outside of the country , of course they will , just like the officials .
when the country needs me , I 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness
I can just take a look , and dare not to speak my mind , the police can grab people , thread starter , I admire you for daring to speak ! Bump !
The ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators and traitors of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> !
Comrade <PERSON>Deng Xiaoping</PERSON> once said that the Communist Party will not be overthrown - if it falls , it will be brought down from within the party itself .
Former US Ambassador to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> <PERSON>Mr. Huntsman</PERSON> once said in a speech in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> : we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , let the Chinese themselves topple <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> -
and the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> then used an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so - called elite , vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically , citizens definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsiders use us .
